# The Core Immutable Principles of the Constitution of Canada

---

### PREAMBLE
These Core Principles are the unchangeable and permanent foundation of the nation, derived from the supreme moral law of the Holy Bible. They are immutable and shall not be altered or repealed. All other laws and constitutional articles must be in conformity with them.

---

### ARTICLE 1: THE SANCTITY OF LIFE

1.  All human life is sacred, having been created in the image of God. As such, it is a divine endowment which the state has no authority to extinguish.

2.  For the purposes of this Article, a human life is recognized as beginning at the moment of conception. The protection afforded by this constitution extends to all human beings from that point forward until natural death. Accordingly, acts intended to prematurely end a human life, including euthanasia and assisted suicide, are prohibited. This principle, however, does not obligate any individual to accept unwanted medical treatment.

3.  The authority to end a life belongs to God alone. Therefore, capital punishment is irrevocably abolished. No law shall permit it, and no sentence of death shall ever be carried out. This prohibition does not extend to the necessary use of lethal force in the immediate defense of human life under the following circumstances:
    (a) By a duly authorized agent of the state, when acting against an imminent threat of death or grievous bodily harm.
    (b) By a private citizen, when defending against an unlawful and imminent threat of death or grievous bodily harm to themselves or another innocent person.

4.  **Sentencing for Capital Offenses.** To ensure justice is served and society is protected, the state shall have the power to impose a sentence of imprisonment for the full remainder of the convicted person's natural life, making them ineligible for parole.

5.  **Special Mandate for Heinous Crimes Against Children.**
    (a) **Preamble and Principle of Exceptionalism:** In remembrance of the solemn warning that it would be better for a man to be cast into the sea with a millstone about his neck than to cause a child to stumble, the state shall treat such crimes as a supreme offense against God and the nation. These acts are recognized as being exceptional in their depravity, causing profound and often permanent spiritual and psychological harm that violates the sanctity of life at its most vulnerable stage. For this reason, the sentencing for these crimes is removed from ordinary judicial discretion and is hereby fixed by this constitution.
    (b) **Mandatory Application for Crimes Against Young Children:** Any person convicted of a Heinous Crime Against a Child, where the victim is below the age of fourteen, shall be sentenced to imprisonment for the full remainder of their natural life. This sentence is mandatory, absolute, and shall not be subject to appeal for its severity, nor shall the convicted person ever be eligible for parole.
    (c) **Presumptive Application for Crimes Against Older Minors:** Where a person is convicted of a Heinous Crime Against a Child and the victim is aged fourteen or fifteen, the sentence shall be a presumptive penalty of imprisonment for the full remainder of their natural life without parole. A judge may only depart from this presumptive sentence if they issue a formal written finding that extraordinary and compelling mitigating factors, not related to the offenderâ€™s potential for rehabilitation, make the sentence grossly disproportionate to the specific offense.
    (d) **Definition of a Heinous Crime Against a Child:** For the purposes of this Article, a "Heinous Crime Against a Child" is defined as any of the following acts committed against a person below the age of sixteen:
        (i) Murder, kidnapping, or human trafficking.
        (ii) **Aggravated Sexual Assault,** which includes any sexual act perpetrated through force, coercion, or where the victim is incapable of consent due to age, and which involves penetration, serious physical injury, or was committed by a person in a position of formal trust or authority.
        (iii) **Predatory Grooming,** which is defined as a systematic course of conduct by which an adult intentionally cultivates a relationship with a child, or a child's family, for the ultimate purpose of committing an act defined under sub-clause (ii). A conviction for an act under sub-clause (ii) that was preceded by such a course of conduct shall fall under this mandate. For the purpose of establishing the actor's intent, this ultimate purpose may be inferred by the court or jury from a demonstrated pattern of conduct that is deceptive, isolating, or serves to undermine parental authority and natural boundaries.

6.  **Clarification on Redemption and Societal Justice.** The immutable sentences prescribed in this Article do not constitute a theological judgment on the possibility of an individual's spiritual repentance, which is a matter between that person and God. They constitute a legal and societal judgment that the commission of such a heinous act represents an absolute forfeiture of the right to live in free society, and that the protection of the innocent and the demands of retributive justice require the offender's permanent removal from it.

7.  **Exceptions.** The exceptions for **Proof of Innocence** and **Executive Clemency** as defined below shall apply to all sentences imposed under this Article.
    (a) **Proof of Innocence:** If evidence emerges that conclusively proves the factual innocence of the person, the conviction and sentence shall be nullified, and they shall be immediately released.
    (b) **Executive Clemency:** In extraordinary and rare circumstances not related to rehabilitation, the Head of State may grant a single commutation of sentence to a lesser penalty, but only upon the recommendation of a three-quarters supermajority of the full Supreme Court.

---

### ARTICLE 2: FREEDOM OF RELIGION AND WORSHIP

1.  Canada is founded upon the principles of Christianity. The Holy Bible is recognized as the ultimate source of the nation's guiding moral code, and the state shall conduct its public life and ceremonies in a manner that reflects this foundation.

2.  In accordance with the principle of God-given freewill, every individual possesses the freedom of conscience and religion. This freedom includes the absolute right to hold, to declare, and to peacefully manifest their beliefs. It protects the right to worship, whether publicly or privately, alone or in community with others, and the right to change one's religion or to hold no religion at all.

3.  The exercise of religious freedom does not provide immunity from the law. No individual or group may use religious belief to justify any act that violates the Core Immutable Principles of this constitution or the laws of the nation that derive from them.

---

### ARTICLE 3: THE NATURE OF THE FAMILY AND MARRIAGE

1.  The family, as founded upon the covenant of Marriage, is recognized as a natural and fundamental group unit of society, ordained by God as an essential foundation for a healthy and stable nation. The state has a solemn duty to recognize and protect its unique and vital status.

2.  Marriage is hereby defined as a sacred covenant of lifelong commitment exclusively between one man and one woman.

3.  Parents are endowed with the primary right and solemn duty to direct the upbringing, education, and moral instruction of their children. The state's authority to intervene in the family is strictly limited and may only be exercised under the following conditions:
    (a) **Physical Harm:** In cases of physical abuse, abandonment, or neglect that create a direct and imminent threat to a child's physical health or their Right to Life as protected under Article 1.
    (b) **Profound Educational Neglect:** In cases where there is a demonstrable failure to provide a child with a foundational education in literacy and numeracy. The state's power in this regard is limited to ensuring these foundational skills are acquired and does not extend to dictating curriculum content.

4.  For the specific purpose of protecting minors and young adults from interventions with lifelong consequences, the age of medical majority is hereby constitutionally established at twenty-one years of age. The state, its agents, and all medical institutions are prohibited from performing, facilitating, or funding any of the following procedures on any person below this age:
    (a) Surgical procedures that alter primary or secondary sex characteristics to imitate the opposite sex.
    (b) The administration of hormones, including puberty-blocking agents or cross-sex hormones, with the intent or effect of arresting natural development or inducing the characteristics of the opposite sex.
    Any adult who unlawfully facilitates such a procedure for a person below this age shall be held legally accountable. For greater clarity, these prohibitions do not apply to medically necessary surgical procedures intended to correct a congenital defect, treat a physical injury, or remove a pathology.

5.  The legislature may provide for secular legal contracts to address matters of property and inheritance for households not founded upon the covenant of Marriage.

---

### ARTICLE 4: FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND TRUTHFUL EXPRESSION

1.  Recognizing that God has endowed humanity with reason and conscience, freedom of expression is hereby established as a fundamental right. This right is an essential pillar for accountable government, the exercise of religious conscience, the pursuit of knowledge, and the flourishing of a just and open society.

2.  The freedom of expression is not absolute. The following forms of expression receive no constitutional protection:
    (a) **Defamation:** The act of knowingly making a public, false statement of fact that causes material harm to the reputation of another person. Truth shall be an absolute defense against any charge of defamation. For speech concerning public officials or matters of public concern, the person bringing the charge must also prove that the statement was made with malicious intent.
    (b) **Bearing False Witness:** Knowingly providing false testimony in judicial or official proceedings.
    (c) **Obscenity:** The commercial production or distribution of hard-core pornography, which is defined as explicit pictorial or textual depictions of sexual acts that, when taken as a whole, appeal to a prurient interest and lack serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.
    (d) **Public Desecration:** The act of intentionally and publicly desecrating a recognized place of worship (such as a church, synagogue, or mosque) or its sacred objects. This includes disrupting a formal religious service with the clear intent to mock and show contempt for the faith of the worshippers.
    (e) **Direct Incitement to Violence:** Speech which directly and intentionally advocates for immediate violence against a person or group, in violation of Article 1.

3.  To ensure government accountability, robust and honest public debate concerning political matters is protected. A person may not be punished for expressing criticism of the government, its policies, its institutions, or its officials, provided such expression does not constitute a direct incitement to violence as defined in Clause 2(e).

---

### ARTICLE 5: SECURITY FROM UNREASONABLE STATE INTRUSION

Recognizing that the home, private affairs, and conscience of a citizen are sacred domains into which the state may not arbitrarily intrude, the following rights are hereby established as immutable.

1.  **The Right to Security:** The right of the people to be secure in their persons, homes, papers, effects, and in the content of their digital communications and data against unreasonable state intrusion shall not be violated.

2.  **The Mandate for a Warrant:** A warrant, issued by a neutral judge, is the mandatory prerequisite for any search or seizure conducted by agents of the state. Any state action not founded upon such a warrant is presumptively unreasonable.

3.  **Standards for a Warrant:** No warrant shall issue, but upon:
    (a) **Probable Cause,** established by a substantial and credible showing of facts that a specific crime has been committed and that specific evidence of that crime will be found in the place to be searched.
    (b) **A sworn Oath or Affirmation,** holding the affiant personally accountable for the truthfulness of their statements.
    (c) **Particularity.** General warrants are forever prohibited. The warrant must describe with precision the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized, and the search shall not extend beyond these specified bounds.

4.  **The Exclusionary Rule:** Evidence obtained in violation of this Article is "fruit of the poisonous tree." Such evidence, and any knowledge derived directly from it, is inadmissible in any legal proceeding, for any purpose. This prohibition is absolute and shall not be subject to any "good faith" exception. It is established as a necessary deterrent to state misconduct and as a defense of the integrity of the law itself.

5.  **Exceptions to the Warrant Requirement:** A warrantless search or seizure is permissible only under the following, and only the following, exigent circumstances. In any such case, the burden of proof rests entirely upon the state to demonstrate that the circumstance was genuine and not created by its own agents.
    (a) **Consent:** A search conducted pursuant to consent that is demonstrably voluntary and uncoerced. To be considered valid, consent to search a home or person must be affirmed by the citizen, **in writing or on an audio-visual recording**, after they have been explicitly informed of their absolute right to refuse.
    (b) **Exigent Circumstances:** When an officer has probable cause to believe that a delay to obtain a warrant would result in **imminent and grave bodily harm or death** to any person. A belief that evidence may be destroyed is insufficient grounds for this exception.
    (c) **Search Incident to a Lawful Arrest:** Upon a lawful arrest, an officer may search the arrested person's body and the area within their immediate reach for the sole purpose of discovering weapons that pose a threat to the officer or the public. This exception does not extend to a search of the contents of any electronic device. A separate warrant is required to search digital data.
    (d) The Plain View Doctrine is not an exception to the requirement to obtain a warrant to enter a protected space, but clarifies that an officer who is already lawfully present in a location may seize contraband or evidence that is in plain sight without a separate warrant for the seizure itself.

6.  **Clarifications on Scope and Application:** The protections of this Article are established in the context of criminal investigation. They shall not be construed to prohibit the following legitimate, non-criminal state functions:
    (a) **International Border Security:** The state may conduct routine, warrantless searches of persons and goods **only at the physical international borders of the nation.** At such locations, any search that is more than minimally intrusive, including but not limited to body searches or any search that accesses the content of an electronic device, requires a warrant issued upon a showing of probable cause, which may be obtained from a duty judge by telephonic or other remote means. Any evidence of a crime discovered during a border search shall be inadmissible if it is shown that the search was used as a pretext for a domestic criminal investigation.
    (b) **Administrative and Safety Inspections:** The legislature may authorize programs for legitimate, non-criminal administrative inspections of commercial premises or licensed activities to ensure public health and safety. Furthermore, fixed checkpoints on public thoroughfares may be established for the limited and specific purpose of agricultural quarantine or vehicle safety inspection, provided they meet the following strict criteria: (i) the location and time are pre-authorized by a supervising authority, not by the officers in the field; (ii) they are applied to all persons in a non-discretionary, sequential pattern, such as every person or every fifth person; and (iii) the intrusion is minimal and limited to the stated purpose.
    (c) **The Burden of Proof for Pretext:** In any case where a citizen alleges that an administrative inspection or checkpoint was used as a pretext for a criminal search, the burden of proof shall rest upon the state. **Pretext shall be presumed if a criminal investigation into the person or premises was active prior to the administrative inspection.** The state can only overcome this presumption by a clear and convincing showing that the administrative inspection was independently initiated and scheduled without influence from criminal investigators.

7.  **Prohibition Against the Quartering of Soldiers.**
    (a) **Peace:** In time of peace, no soldier shall be quartered in any house without the explicit and uncoerced consent of the owner.
    (b) **War:** The quartering of soldiers in a time of war is prohibited, except under the following, and only the following, exhaustive conditions:
        (i) **Triggering Event:** The Legislature must have first issued a formal Declaration of War in response to **a sustained, armed invasion of the nation's continental territory by the formal military forces of another sovereign power.** This clause may not be invoked in response to acts of terrorism, civil unrest, or undeclared border skirmishes.
        (ii) **Legislative Act:** The Legislature must then pass a "Wartime Quartering Act," approved by a three-quarters supermajority vote in both houses. This Act must be **specific in its scope, designating the specific geographic regions or provinces where it applies** and may not grant a blanket, nationwide authority.
        (iii) **Duration:** This Act shall automatically expire 12 months after its passage. It may be renewed for subsequent 6-month periods only by another three-quarters supermajority vote.
        (iv) **Compensation Protocol:** Any Wartime Quartering Act must contain a **"Just Compensation Protocol."** This protocol shall establish a special post-conflict tribunal to assess claims. The standard for compensation shall be **the fair market replacement value of the property, as assessed on the day prior to the formal Declaration of War.** Compensation is a binding entitlement and shall be paid within one year of the conflict's conclusion. The failure to pay compensation in a timely manner after the conflict does not render the original quartering unconstitutional, but instead creates a sovereign debt owed to the citizen, bearing interest at a rate fixed by law.

### ARTICLE 6: RIGHTS OF THE ACCUSED IN CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS

Recognizing that the power to prosecute is the state's most coercive tool, and that the integrity of justice depends upon a fair process that respects the dignity of the individual, the following rights are hereby established as immutable.

**Section 1: The Prohibition Against Double Jeopardy**

1.  **Finality of Judgment:** When a person has been subjected to a trial for a criminal offense and a final verdict has been rendered, that person is forever barred from being prosecuted again for the same offense by **any level of government within the nation, whether municipal, provincial, or federal.**

2.  **Definition of "Same Offense":** For the purpose of this Article, "same offense" includes not only the specific crime charged but also any lesser offense necessarily included within it, and any greater offense that could have been charged based on the same criminal act or transaction.

3.  **Exceptions:** The prohibition against double jeopardy shall not apply under the following, and only the following, circumstances:
    (a) **Appeal by the Accused:** If a convicted person successfully appeals their conviction and it is overturned on procedural grounds, the state may conduct one new trial.
    (b) **Manifest Necessity:** If a trial is terminated before a final verdict due to a catastrophic and irremediable defect not caused by prosecutorial misconduct.
    (c) **Fraud Upon the Court:** If conclusive evidence emerges, after an acquittal, that the verdict was procured by the accused through bribery of a judge, juror, or material officer of the court, the Supreme Court may authorize a single new trial.

**Section 2: The Right Against Compelled Self-Incrimination**

1.  **Burden of Proof:** In all criminal matters, the burden of proof rests entirely upon the state.

2.  **The Right to Silence of the Individual:** An individual human being cannot be compelled in any criminal case to provide testimony against themselves.
    (a) An accused person cannot be compelled to take the witness stand at their own trial.
    (b) The exercise of this right to silence, at any stage of an investigation or trial, shall not be used in any way to impeach the credibility of the accused, nor shall any adverse inference be drawn from it.

3.  **Immunity and Compelled Testimony:** The legislature may enact laws permitting a prosecutor, with judicial approval, to grant a person "use and derivative use immunity." This is a binding promise that the compelled testimony, and any evidence derived directly from it, will not be used to prosecute that individual. Upon receiving such a grant of immunity, the person may be compelled to testify. A refusal to testify after a grant of immunity may be subject to penalty.

4.  **Scope of the Right:** This right protects a natural person from being compelled to provide self-incriminating testimony. It does not extend to:
    (a) The compelled provision of physical, non-testimonial evidence such as fingerprints or DNA samples.
    (b) **Artificial Entities.** Corporations, associations, or other collective entities may not claim this right. They can be compelled to produce documents and records. An individual custodian of records cannot refuse to produce them by claiming the act of production would incriminate the entity.

---

### ARTICLE 7: PROPERTY, STEWARDSHIP, AND SOUND MONEY

1.  Recognizing that God is sovereign over all creation, the right of individuals and families to own and control property as stewards is hereby established as a fundamental pillar of liberty. This right is inviolable, and the principles of stewardship are a matter of private conscience and religious duty, not a pretext for state intervention.

2.  **For greater clarity, the right to property shall extend to both real property (land and chattels) and intellectual property, including patents, copyrights, and trade secrets, lawfully held by a citizen or a "Qualified Domestic Corporation." A Qualified Domestic Corporation is hereby defined as a corporation in which a majority of the voting shares are held by citizens of the nation and which is not subject to the control or direction of a foreign state or entity. The Legislature shall provide for the strong enforcement of these rights and create severe penalties for their theft or infringement, particularly by foreign state actors.**

3.  For all constitutional purposes, government revenue is classified into two distinct types:
    (a) **Tax Revenue:** All funds collected from individuals and corporations through direct or indirect taxation.
    (b) **Stewardship Revenue:** All net income generated from the profitable management of federal assets, including mineral rights and state-owned enterprises.

4.  The total Tax Revenue collected by the federal government in any given year shall not exceed ten percent (10%) of the nation's Gross Domestic Product for the previous year. The federal income tax shall be levied at a single, uniform rate.

5.  The first allocation of the federal budget each year shall be a deposit into the National Emergency Fund. This deposit shall be equal to five percent (5%) of the previous year's Total Tax Revenue. This deposit is non-negotiable. All Stewardship Revenue collected in a given year shall be used for one of two purposes only: to make an additional deposit into the National Emergency Fund, or to pay down the principal of the national debt. After the mandatory deposit into the Emergency Fund is made, the remainder of the federal operating budget for that year must be balanced. The government is prohibited from running a deficit for its operational spending.

6.  The National Emergency Fund is inviolable and may only be disbursed after a national emergency is declared under the strict protocols of Clause 7. Its assets shall be held exclusively in Canadian sovereign debt or physical gold. Following the end of a declared national emergency during which the Fund was used, the mandatory deposit rate shall be responsive to the health of the economy. In any year that the nation's real GDP growth exceeds three percent (3%), the deposit rate shall be increased to ten percent (10%). In any year that real GDP growth is below three percent, the rate shall remain at the standard five percent. This shall continue until the Fund is fully replenished.

7.  **Protocol for Suspending Fiscal Limitations in a National Emergency.** The fiscal limitations in Clause 4 may be temporarily suspended only by adhering to one of the following two protocols:
    (a) **In the Event of War or Sudden Catastrophe:** In the event of a formal Declaration of War following an armed attack on the nation, or in response to a sudden and catastrophic physical event that has occurred and which poses an immediate threat to the nation's existence, the legislature may declare a State of Emergency by a three-quarters supermajority vote in both legislative houses.
    (b) **In the Event of a Protracted Existential Crisis:** To address a developing and foreseeable crisis that threatens to cause the collapse of the national economy or mass casualties on a scale that endangers the nation's continuity, the following strict procedure is established:
        (i) The legislature, by a two-thirds supermajority vote, may pass an **"Act of Petition,"** which must clearly articulate the specific nature of the existential crisis and the proposed scope of the emergency powers sought.
        (ii) This Act of Petition is then transmitted to the Supreme Court. The Court's role is not to rule on the validity of the crisis itself, but to **authorize a national referendum** on the petition. The Court shall grant this authorization unless it finds, by a supermajority vote, that the petition is frivolous, brought in bad faith, or addresses a matter that is plainly not within the constitutional definition of an existential crisis.
        (iii) Upon receiving judicial authorization, the government shall conduct a national, binding referendum. The legislature's petition is enacted, and a State of Emergency is declared, only if it is approved by a **three-fifths (60%) majority of the national electorate.**
    (c) **Limitations and Hierarchy:**
        (i) Any State of Emergency declared shall automatically expire after 24 months. Renewal requires the process to be initiated again from the beginning.
        (ii) The legislature must establish separate and strictly segregated emergency funds for each declared crisis. The co-mingling of funds is prohibited. In the event of concurrent emergencies, funds raised under a Declaration of War shall have fiscal priority.
        (iii) For greater clarity, the term "collapse of the national economy" refers to a systemic failure of the nation's financial system and core supply chains. The term shall not be construed to mean a routine recession or economic downturn.

---

### ARTICLE 8: PRIVATE CHARITY AND NATIONAL BENEVOLENCE

1.  **Recognition and Protection:** The state recognizes that the primary duty and most effective means of caring for the poor, the widow, and the orphan resides with religious institutions and private citizens. The legislature is prohibited from enacting any law whose primary purpose or principal effect is to impede, usurp, or supplant the core charitable mission of a Qualified Charitable Organization.

2.  **Submission to Law:** This protection shall not be construed to create immunity from the law. All such organizations are subject to neutral, generally applicable laws, including but not limited to:
    (a) Criminal statutes concerning fraud, theft, and bodily harm.
    (b) Health, safety, and zoning ordinances essential for public welfare.
    (c) Laws governing contracts, property ownership, and employment.

3.  **Tax Exemption and Deduction:** All donations to a Qualified Charitable Organization shall be exempt from taxation. A taxpayer may claim a deduction for such donations, but the total annual deduction shall not exceed fifty percent (50%) of the taxpayer's gross income, calculated before the application of this deduction.

4.  **Definition of a Qualified Charitable Organization (QCO):** To be designated a QCO and receive the protections and benefits of this Article, an institution must meet, and annually verify, the following non-negotiable criteria:
    (a) **The Public Benefit Mandate:** The organization's *exclusive* purpose and activity must be public benevolence. It is explicitly prohibited from acting as a political action committee, endorsing candidates for public office, or engaging in for-profit commercial activity not directly related to its mission.
    (b) **The Fiduciary Integrity Clause:** The organization must be governed by a Board of Directors of no fewer than five individuals. To ensure independence:
        (i) No more than one-third of the board members may be related by blood or marriage to any other board member or to the organization's senior executives.
        (ii) No board member, nor any company they hold a major interest in, may engage in a financial transaction with the organization from which they derive personal profit.
    (c) **The Efficiency and Transparency Standard:** The organization must demonstrate superlative stewardship by:
        (i) Submitting to an annual, independent financial audit, the complete text of which must be published in a publicly accessible digital format.
        (ii) Directing a minimum of eighty percent (80%) of its total annual expenditures to Direct Program Services, defined as the goods, services, and funds delivered directly to the intended beneficiaries.
        (iii) Limiting total annual expenditures on combined administrative overhead and fundraising to a maximum of twenty percent (20%). Salaries for executive officers shall be classified as administrative overhead.

### ARTICLE 9: THE RIGHT OF THE PEOPLE TO KEEP AND BEAR ARMS

1.  The right of the people to keep and bear arms, as a necessary means of defending their life, family, and liberty against both criminal and tyrannical threats, shall not be infringed.

2.  **To ensure a state of readiness for the common defense and to provide a disciplined body capable of rendering aid during catastrophic civil emergencies, and without diminishing the primary right of individual self-defense as secured in Clause 1, this Charter recognizes the principle of a well-regulated militia. The specific duties, structure, and activation protocols for the militia shall be detailed in the Constitution of Government.**

3.  For the purpose of this Article, "the people" shall be understood to include all adult citizens not otherwise disqualified by this constitution. The legislature is empowered to pass laws prohibiting the possession of arms by the following classes of individuals only:
    (a) **Convicted Felons,** specifically those convicted of violent crimes or crimes of a treasonous nature.
    (b) **The Mentally Infirm,** specifically those who have been formally and legally adjudicated by a court of law as a danger to themselves or others.
    (c) **Non-citizens** of the nation.
    (d) **Individuals Under Pre-Trial Restriction,** specifically a person currently released on bail or pre-trial supervision for a credible charge of a violent felony. This prohibition is temporary and lasts only for the duration of the pre-trial period, and the initial finding of a "credible charge" must be made by a judge during a formal bail hearing.

4.  The right to keep and bear arms is absolute regarding the type and quantity of arms an individual may possess. The state shall make no law restricting the ownership of any category of conventional arms, including but not limited to semi-automatic or fully automatic firearms, suppressors, body armor, and conventional explosives.

5.  This absolute right does not extend to arms whose nature is to cause death or grievous bodily harm in an indiscriminate manner over a wide area, without the possibility of being aimed at a specific threat. The development or possession of any such device by private citizens is prohibited.

6.  To prevent the erosion of this right through indirect means, the state is hereby prohibited from:
    (a) Establishing any registry of firearms or their owners.
    (b) Implementing any law that has the effect of confiscating legally owned arms.
    (c) Requiring any form of compulsory buy-back program.

7.  The state's power to regulate the exercise of this right is strictly limited to the following:
    (a) **Background Checks:** The state may require instant background checks at the point of sale to verify that a potential buyer is not a member of a disqualified class as defined in Clause 3.
    (b) **Sensitive Places:** The legislature may prohibit the carrying of arms into highly sensitive areas where security is paramount, specifically: legislative chambers, courtrooms, and secure military installations.
    (c) **Private Property Rights:** Private property owners retain the right to prohibit or permit the carrying of arms on their own premises.

---

### ARTICLE 10: THE CITIZEN'S OVERSIGHT TRIBUNE

1.  **Mandate:** To ensure perpetual transparency, accountability, and fiscal prudence in government, and to serve as the people's ultimate check on the power of the state, there is hereby established the Citizen's Oversight Tribune.

2.  **The Citizen Reserve:**
    (a) **Composition and Term:** The foundation of the Tribune shall be the Citizen Reserve. Every two years, 500 citizens shall be selected by national lottery for a single, non-renewable ten-year term of service.
    (b) **Civic Duty and Compensation:** Service in the Reserve is a primary civic duty. A citizen may only decline for reasons of significant personal hardship or conscientious objection, as determined by a judicial review panel. All Reservists shall receive a substantial annual stipend.
    (c) **Training and Curriculum:** Reservists shall remain in their civilian lives and undergo continuous part-time training. The training curriculum shall be developed by an independent board, but all changes must be ratified by a two-thirds vote of the Active Council. The curriculum shall be a public document.

3.  **The Active Council:**
    (a) **Composition and Tour of Duty:** The primary working body of the Tribune shall be the Active Council, composed of 101 Reservists selected by lottery from those with at least two years of training. Members shall serve a single, intensive one-year tour of duty, during which they shall receive a salary equivalent to that of a Supreme Court Justice. The Council shall be refreshed with approximately 50 new members every six months.
    (b) **Post-Service Role:** After their tour, members return to the Reserve as Senior Reservists, responsible for mentoring new members.

4.  **Powers of the Active Council:** The Council is endowed with the powers of Absolute Investigation, Presentment to the Courts through its own Special Prosecutor, and Legislative Review via the "Mandatory Public Response" protocol.

5.  **Incorruptibility Protocols:** Any member convicted of corruption shall be guilty of a high crime. Upon honorable completion of their full ten-year term, each citizen shall receive a lifetime Service Pension, which is forfeit upon any such conviction.

6.  **The People's Referendum of No Confidence:** If the legislature, by a three-quarters supermajority vote, declares that the Tribune has acted in a systematically corrupt or tyrannical manner, it may call for a national referendum on its dismissal. If a majority of the nation's citizens vote in favor, the entire Tribune is dissolved and a new selection process begins. This power may not be used more than once per decade.

---

### ARTICLE 11: EQUALITY OF RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITY

1.  To reflect the equal dignity of all persons created in the image of God, every citizen is equal before and under the law and possesses the right to the equal protection and equal benefit of the law, without advantage or disadvantage based on sex.

2.  This equality extends to all civil and political rights, duties, and privileges, including but not limited to the right to own and inherit property, to form contracts, to receive an education, to pursue a trade or profession, and to vote and hold public office.

3.  The purpose of this Article is to guarantee **equality of individual opportunity**, not to engineer equality of statistical outcomes between groups. A law shall be deemed non-discriminatory if it applies to all individuals equally, regardless of their sex. A statistical imbalance in any profession, institution, or area of life shall not, in itself, be considered proof of a violation of this Article.

4.  For greater clarity, this Article shall not be construed in a manner that abrogates, diminishes, or reinterprets the principles, definitions, and distinctions established in Article 3 of this Charter concerning the nature of Marriage and the family.

### ARTICLE 12: NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY

1.  Canada is a sovereign and independent nation. The ultimate authority for all governance resides exclusively with the people of Canada through this Charter and the Constitution of Government. No law or directive originating from a foreign power, international body, private foundation, or non-governmental organization shall have legal force within the nation, unless it is explicitly and lawfully adopted through the nation's own legislative process.

2.  International treaties are instruments of national policy and are subordinate to this Charter. Should a conflict arise between a treaty and the Charter, the Charter shall prevail. However, for the purpose of maintaining international trust and order, any provision of a ratified treaty that is found by the Supreme Court to conflict with the **amendable Constitution of Government** shall not be immediately voided. Instead, the government shall be constitutionally obligated to either: (a) formally withdraw from the conflicting provision of the treaty, or (b) initiate the process to amend the Constitution of Government to resolve the conflict.

3.  To preserve political integrity, the Legislature shall pass, and the executive shall enforce, laws prohibiting any foreign entity or non-citizen from directly or indirectly funding, directing, or influencing domestic political outcomes. These laws shall specifically include prohibitions on:
    (a) Contributions to political candidates, parties, referendums, or political action committees.
    (b) The channeling of funds through domestic non-profit or charitable organizations for the purpose of undertaking partisan political advocacy or issue-based campaigns intended to influence an election or legislation. A charitable organization's funding shall be presumed to be for a prohibited purpose if more than ten percent of its total annual budget originates from foreign sources.

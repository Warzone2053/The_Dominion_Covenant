# The Core Immutable Principles of the Constitution of Canada

---

### PREAMBLE
These Core Principles are the unchangeable and permanent foundation of the nation, derived from the supreme moral law of the Holy Bible. They are immutable and shall not be altered or repealed. All other laws and constitutional articles must be in conformity with them.

---

### ARTICLE 1: THE SANCTITY OF LIFE

1.  All human life is sacred, having been created in the image of God. As such, it is a divine endowment which the state has no authority to extinguish.

2.  For the purposes of this Article, a human life is recognized as beginning at the moment of conception. The protection afforded by this constitution extends to all human beings from that point forward until natural death. Accordingly, acts intended to prematurely end a human life, including euthanasia and assisted suicide, are prohibited. This principle, however, does not obligate any individual to accept unwanted medical treatment.

3.  The authority to end a life belongs to God alone. Therefore, capital punishment is irrevocably abolished. No law shall permit it, and no sentence of death shall ever be carried out. This prohibition does not extend to the necessary use of lethal force in the immediate defense of human life under the following circumstances:
    (a) By a duly authorized agent of the state, when acting against an imminent threat of death or grievous bodily harm.
    (b) By a private citizen, when defending against an unlawful and imminent threat of death or grievous bodily harm to themselves or another innocent person.

4.  To ensure justice is served and society is protected, the state shall have the power to impose a sentence of imprisonment for the full remainder of the convicted person's natural life, making them ineligible for parole. This sentence shall be subject to only two exceptions:
    (a) **Proof of Innocence:** If evidence emerges that conclusively proves the factual innocence of the person, the conviction and sentence shall be nullified, and they shall be immediately released.
    (b) **Executive Clemency:** In extraordinary and rare circumstances not related to rehabilitation, the Head of State may grant a single commutation of sentence to a lesser penalty, but only upon the unanimous recommendation of the Supreme Court.

---

### ARTICLE 2: FREEDOM OF RELIGION AND WORSHIP

1.  Canada is founded upon the principles of Christianity. The Holy Bible is recognized as the ultimate source of the nation's guiding moral code, and the state shall conduct its public life and ceremonies in a manner that reflects this foundation.

2.  In accordance with the principle of God-given freewill, every individual possesses the freedom of conscience and religion. This freedom includes the absolute right to hold, to declare, and to peacefully manifest their beliefs. It protects the right to worship, whether publicly or privately, alone or in community with others, and the right to change one's religion or to hold no religion at all.

3.  The exercise of religious freedom does not provide immunity from the law. No individual or group may use religious belief to justify any act that violates the Core Immutable Principles of this constitution or the laws of the nation that derive from them.

### ARTICLE 3: THE NATURE OF THE FAMILY AND MARRIAGE

1.  The family, as founded upon the covenant of Marriage, is recognized as a natural and fundamental group unit of society, ordained by God as an essential foundation for a healthy and stable nation. The state has a solemn duty to recognize and protect its unique and vital status.

2.  Marriage is hereby defined as a sacred covenant of lifelong commitment exclusively between one man and one woman.

3.  Parents are endowed with the primary right and solemn duty to direct the upbringing, education, and moral instruction of their children. The state's authority to intervene in the family is strictly limited and may only be exercised under the following conditions:
    (a) **Physical Harm:** In cases of physical abuse, abandonment, or neglect that create a direct and imminent threat to a child's physical health or their Right to Life as protected under Article 1.
    (b) **Profound Educational Neglect:** In cases where there is a demonstrable failure to provide a child with a foundational education in literacy and numeracy. The state's power in this regard is limited to ensuring these foundational skills are acquired and does not extend to dictating curriculum content.

4.  For the specific purpose of protecting minors and young adults from interventions with lifelong consequences, the age of medical majority is hereby constitutionally established at twenty-one years of age. The state, its agents, and all medical institutions are prohibited from performing, facilitating, or funding any of the following procedures on any person below this age:
    (a) Surgical procedures that alter primary or secondary sex characteristics to imitate the opposite sex.
    (b) The administration of hormones, including puberty-blocking agents or cross-sex hormones, with the intent or effect of arresting natural development or inducing the characteristics of the opposite sex.
    Any adult who unlawfully facilitates such a procedure for a person below this age shall be held legally accountable. For greater clarity, these prohibitions do not apply to medically necessary surgical procedures intended to correct a congenital defect, treat a physical injury, or remove a pathology.

5.  The legislature may provide for secular legal contracts to address matters of property and inheritance for households not founded upon the covenant of Marriage.

### ARTICLE 4: FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND TRUTHFUL EXPRESSION

1.  Recognizing that God has endowed humanity with reason and conscience, freedom of expression is hereby established as a fundamental right. This right is an essential pillar for accountable government, the exercise of religious conscience, the pursuit of knowledge, and the flourishing of a just and open society.

2.  The freedom of expression is not absolute. The following forms of expression receive no constitutional protection:
    (a) **Defamation:** The act of knowingly making a public, false statement of fact that causes material harm to the reputation of another person. Truth shall be an absolute defense against any charge of defamation. For speech concerning public officials or matters of public concern, the person bringing the charge must also prove that the statement was made with malicious intent.
    (b) **Bearing False Witness:** Knowingly providing false testimony in judicial or official proceedings.
    (c) **Obscenity:** The commercial production or distribution of hard-core pornography, which is defined as explicit pictorial or textual depictions of sexual acts that, when taken as a whole, appeal to a prurient interest and lack serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.
    (d) **Public Desecration:** The act of intentionally and publicly desecrating a recognized place of worship (such as a church, synagogue, or mosque) or its sacred objects. This includes disrupting a formal religious service with the clear intent to mock and show contempt for the faith of the worshippers.
    (e) **Direct Incitement to Violence:** Speech which directly and intentionally advocates for immediate violence against a person or group, in violation of Article 1.

3.  To ensure government accountability, robust and honest public debate concerning political matters is protected. A person may not be punished for expressing criticism of the government, its policies, its institutions, or its officials, provided such expression does not constitute a direct incitement to violence as defined in Clause 2(e).

### ARTICLE 5: PROPERTY, STEWARDSHIP, AND SOUND MONEY

1.  Recognizing that God is sovereign over all creation, the right of individuals and families to own and control property as stewards is hereby established as a fundamental pillar of liberty. This right is inviolable, and the principles of stewardship are a matter of private conscience and religious duty, not a pretext for state intervention.

2.  For all constitutional purposes, government revenue is classified into two distinct types:
    (a) **Tax Revenue:** All funds collected from individuals and corporations through direct or indirect taxation.
    (b) **Stewardship Revenue:** All net income generated from the profitable management of federal assets, including mineral rights and state-owned enterprises.

3.  The total Tax Revenue collected by the federal government in any given year shall not exceed ten percent (10%) of the nation's Gross Domestic Product for the previous year. The federal income tax shall be levied at a single, uniform rate.

4.  The first allocation of the federal budget each year shall be a deposit into the National Emergency Fund. This deposit shall be equal to five percent (5%) of the previous year's Total Tax Revenue. This deposit is non-negotiable. All Stewardship Revenue collected in a given year shall be used for one of two purposes only: to make an additional deposit into the National Emergency Fund, or to pay down the principal of the national debt. After the mandatory deposit into the Emergency Fund is made, the remainder of the federal operating budget for that year must be balanced. The government is prohibited from running a deficit for its operational spending.

5.  The National Emergency Fund is inviolable and may only be disbursed after a national emergency is declared under the strict protocols of Clause 6. Its assets shall be held exclusively in Canadian sovereign debt or physical gold. Following the end of a declared national emergency during which the Fund was used, the mandatory deposit rate shall be responsive to the health of the economy. In any year that the nation's real GDP growth exceeds three percent (3%), the deposit rate shall be increased to ten percent (10%). In any year that real GDP growth is below three percent, the rate shall remain at the standard five percent. This shall continue until the Fund is fully replenished.

6.  In the event of a formal Declaration of War following an attack on the nation, or in response to a sudden catastrophic event that threatens the existence of the nation, the legislature may temporarily suspend the tax limitation in Clause 3. Such a suspension must be approved by a three-quarters supermajority vote in both legislative houses and shall automatically expire after 24 months unless renewed by the same supermajority vote. All funds raised under this protocol must be exclusively dedicated to resolving the declared emergency.

### ARTICLE 6: PRIVATE CHARITY AND NATIONAL BENEVOLENCE

1.  **Recognition and Protection:** The state recognizes that the primary duty and most effective means of caring for the poor, the widow, and the orphan resides with religious institutions and private citizens. The legislature is prohibited from enacting any law whose primary purpose or principal effect is to impede, usurp, or supplant the core charitable mission of a Qualified Charitable Organization.

2.  **Submission to Law:** This protection shall not be construed to create immunity from the law. All such organizations are subject to neutral, generally applicable laws, including but not limited to:
    (a) Criminal statutes concerning fraud, theft, and bodily harm.
    (b) Health, safety, and zoning ordinances essential for public welfare.
    (c) Laws governing contracts, property ownership, and employment.

3.  **Tax Exemption and Deduction:** All donations to a Qualified Charitable Organization shall be exempt from taxation. A taxpayer may claim a deduction for such donations, but the total annual deduction shall not exceed fifty percent (50%) of the taxpayer's gross income, calculated before the application of this deduction.

4.  **Definition of a Qualified Charitable Organization (QCO):** To be designated a QCO and receive the protections and benefits of this Article, an institution must meet, and annually verify, the following non-negotiable criteria:
    (a) **The Public Benefit Mandate:** The organization's *exclusive* purpose and activity must be public benevolence. It is explicitly prohibited from acting as a political action committee, endorsing candidates for public office, or engaging in for-profit commercial activity not directly related to its mission.
    (b) **The Fiduciary Integrity Clause:** The organization must be governed by a Board of Directors of no fewer than five individuals. To ensure independence:
        (i) No more than one-third of the board members may be related by blood or marriage to any other board member or to the organization's senior executives.
        (ii) No board member, nor any company they hold a major interest in, may engage in a financial transaction with the organization from which they derive personal profit.
    (c) **The Efficiency and Transparency Standard:** The organization must demonstrate superlative stewardship by:
        (i) Submitting to an annual, independent financial audit, the complete text of which must be published in a publicly accessible digital format.
        (ii) Directing a minimum of eighty percent (80%) of its total annual expenditures to Direct Program Services, defined as the goods, services, and funds delivered directly to the intended beneficiaries.
        (iii) Limiting total annual expenditures on combined administrative overhead and fundraising to a maximum of twenty percent (20%). Salaries for executive officers shall be classified as administrative overhead.

### ARTICLE 7: THE RIGHT OF THE PEOPLE TO KEEP AND BEAR ARMS

1.  The right of the people to keep and bear arms, as a necessary means of defending their life, family, and liberty against both criminal and tyrannical threats, shall not be infringed.

2.  For the purpose of this Article, "the people" shall be understood to include all adult citizens not otherwise disqualified by this constitution. The legislature is empowered to pass laws prohibiting the possession of arms by the following classes of individuals only:
    (a) **Convicted Felons,** specifically those convicted of violent crimes or crimes of a treasonous nature.
    (b) **The Mentally Infirm,** specifically those who have been formally and legally adjudicated by a court of law as a danger to themselves or others.
    (c) **Non-citizens** of the nation.
    (d) **Individuals Under Pre-Trial Restriction,** specifically a person currently released on bail or pre-trial supervision for a credible charge of a violent felony. This prohibition is temporary and lasts only for the duration of the pre-trial period, and the initial finding of a "credible charge" must be made by a judge during a formal bail hearing.

3.  The right to keep and bear arms is absolute regarding the type and quantity of arms an individual may possess. The state shall make no law restricting the ownership of any category of conventional arms, including but not limited to semi-automatic or fully automatic firearms, suppressors, body armor, and conventional explosives.

4.  This absolute right does not extend to arms whose nature is to cause death or grievous bodily harm in an indiscriminate manner over a wide area, without the possibility of being aimed at a specific threat. The development or possession of any such device by private citizens is prohibited.

5.  To prevent the erosion of this right through indirect means, the state is hereby prohibited from:
    (a) Establishing any registry of firearms or their owners.
    (b) Implementing any law that has the effect of confiscating legally owned arms.
    (c) Requiring any form of compulsory buy-back program.

6.  The state's power to regulate the exercise of this right is strictly limited to the following:
    (a) **Background Checks:** The state may require instant background checks at the point of sale to verify that a potential buyer is not a member of a disqualified class as defined in Clause 2.
    (b) **Sensitive Places:** The legislature may prohibit the carrying of arms into highly sensitive areas where security is paramount, specifically: legislative chambers, courtrooms, and secure military installations.
    (c) **Private Property Rights:** Private property owners retain the right to prohibit or permit the carrying of arms on their own premises.

### ARTICLE 8: THE CITIZEN'S OVERSIGHT TRIBUNE

1.  **Mandate:** To ensure perpetual transparency, accountability, and fiscal prudence in government, and to serve as the people's ultimate check on the power of the state, there is hereby established the Citizen's Oversight Tribune.

2.  **The Citizen Reserve:**
    (a) **Composition and Term:** The foundation of the Tribune shall be the Citizen Reserve. Every two years, 500 citizens shall be selected by national lottery for a single, non-renewable ten-year term of service.
    (b) **Civic Duty and Compensation:** Service in the Reserve is a primary civic duty. A citizen may only decline for reasons of significant personal hardship or conscientious objection, as determined by a judicial review panel. All Reservists shall receive a substantial annual stipend.
    (c) **Training and Curriculum:** Reservists shall remain in their civilian lives and undergo continuous part-time training. The training curriculum shall be developed by an independent board, but all changes must be ratified by a two-thirds vote of the Active Council. The curriculum shall be a public document.

3.  **The Active Council:**
    (a) **Composition and Tour of Duty:** The primary working body of the Tribune shall be the Active Council, composed of 101 Reservists selected by lottery from those with at least two years of training. Members shall serve a single, intensive one-year tour of duty, during which they shall receive a salary equivalent to that of a Supreme Court Justice. The Council shall be refreshed with approximately 50 new members every six months.
    (b) **Post-Service Role:** After their tour, members return to the Reserve as Senior Reservists, responsible for mentoring new members.

4.  **Powers of the Active Council:** The Council is endowed with the powers of Absolute Investigation, Presentment to the Courts through its own Special Prosecutor, and Legislative Review via the "Mandatory Public Response" protocol.

5.  **Incorruptibility Protocols:** Any member convicted of corruption shall be guilty of a high crime. Upon honorable completion of their full ten-year term, each citizen shall receive a lifetime Service Pension, which is forfeit upon any such conviction.

6.  **The People's Referendum of No Confidence:** If the legislature, by a three-quarters supermajority vote, declares that the Tribune has acted in a systematically corrupt or tyrannical manner, it may call for a national referendum on its dismissal. If a majority of the nation's citizens vote in favor, the entire Tribune is dissolved and a new selection process begins. This power may not be used more than once per decade.

### ARTICLE 9: EQUALITY OF RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITY

1.  To reflect the equal dignity of all persons created in the image of God, every citizen is equal before and under the law and possesses the right to the equal protection and equal benefit of the law, without advantage or disadvantage based on sex.

2.  This equality extends to all civil and political rights, duties, and privileges, including but not limited to the right to own and inherit property, to form contracts, to receive an education, to pursue a trade or profession, and to vote and hold public office.

3.  The purpose of this Article is to guarantee **equality of individual opportunity**, not to engineer equality of statistical outcomes between groups. A law shall be deemed non-discriminatory if it applies to all individuals equally, regardless of their sex. A statistical imbalance in any profession, institution, or area of life shall not, in itself, be considered proof of a violation of this Article.

4.  For greater clarity, this Article shall not be construed in a manner that abrogates, diminishes, or reinterprets the principles, definitions, and distinctions established in Article 3 of this Charter concerning the nature of Marriage and the family.

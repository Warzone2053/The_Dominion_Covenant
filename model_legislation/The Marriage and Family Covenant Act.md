AND WHEREAS this Act is intended to establish these permanent and binding rules, and is therefore a **Framework Act** as defined in **Article II of the Constitution of Government**;

### ARTICLE I: PURPOSE AND DEFINITIONS

**(1) Short Title.** This Act may be cited as **The Marriage and Family Covenant Act**.

**(2) Purpose and Scope.** The purpose of this Act is to uphold and implement the principles of the **Core Immutable Principles** and the **National Covenant** concerning the family. This Act shall:
    (a) Define the legal requirements for entering into the covenant of Marriage.
    (b) Establish the legal framework that recognizes and protects the unique status of the family.
    (c) Define the fundamental rights and responsibilities of parents in the upbringing of their children.
    (d) Provide for the orderly dissolution of a marriage, in strict accordance with the limited grounds established in the Constitution.

**(3) Definitions.** For the purposes of this Act:
    (a) **"Marriage"** means a sacred covenant of lifelong commitment exclusively between **one man and one woman, as these sexes are biologically defined**, as established in **Article 3, Section 2 of the Core Immutable Principles**.
    (b) **"Family"** means the fundamental group unit of society founded upon the covenant of Marriage, consisting of **the parent or parents** and their natural or legally adopted children.
    (c) **"Household"** means the domestic and economic unit established by a married couple. It is the primary unit for the purposes of property ownership, legal residence, and taxation.
    (d) **"Parent"** means the biological father or mother of a child, or a person who has become the legal parent of a child through a formal act of adoption. The rights and responsibilities of parenthood are vested exclusively in these persons.
    (e) **"Child"** means a person who has not yet reached the age of legal majority, which is eighteen (18) years.

---

### ARTICLE II: THE PRINCIPLE OF MARITAL PRIVACY

**(1) The Sanctity of the Marital Covenant.** The state recognizes that the covenant of Marriage creates a unique and sacred sphere of privacy that is foundational to liberty and the integrity of the family. The authority of the state ends at the threshold of the household.

**(2) Absolute Prohibition on State Intrusion.** Nothing in this Act or any other statute shall be construed to grant the state, the courts, or any third party jurisdiction over the private, intimate, and spiritual affairs of a married couple. This absolute prohibition includes, but is not limited to, any inquiry or ruling concerning:
    (a) The nature, frequency, or performance of their sexual relations.
    (b) Their decisions regarding procreation and family planning.
    (c) The specific content of their private religious devotions or spiritual life.

**(3) Limitation on Covenantal Mentorship.** For greater clarity, the moral commitment of sponsoring parents to provide "guidance, mentorship, and support" under a Covenant of Familial Support shall be understood to apply exclusively to the public, practical, and financial aspects of managing a household. It shall not be interpreted to create any right or duty to direct or inquire into the private matters protected by this Article.

---

### ARTICLE III: THE SOLEMNIZATION OF MARRIAGE

**(1) Principle of Public Covenant.** Marriage, being the foundational public institution of the nation, shall be entered into by a public and solemn act. A secret or purely private union shall have no legal force or recognition by the state.

**(2) The Marriage License.**
    (a) As a prerequisite to a marriage ceremony, the two parties shall jointly apply for and be granted a **Marriage License** by the state.
    (b) The state's role in granting this license is strictly administrative and is limited to verifying that the two parties meet the legal requirements for marriage as established in this Act, specifically concerning age and prohibited degrees of kinship.
    (c) The state shall not levy any prohibitive fee for the issuance of a marriage license. The fee shall be nominal and set only to cover the administrative cost of its issuance and registration.

**(3) Authorized Officiants.** A marriage ceremony may be solemnized by any of the following persons, herein referred to as "Authorized Officiants":
    (a) A minister, priest, pastor, or other designated spiritual leader of a recognized religious body.
    (b) A judge of any court or a justice of the peace.
    (c) The captain of a Canadian-flagged vessel while at sea.

**(4) The Covenantal Vows.** For a marriage to be legally valid, the ceremony must include a moment where the two parties, in the presence of the Authorized Officiant and no fewer than two witnesses, make a public and mutual declaration of their covenantal vows. The substance of these vows shall include, at minimum, a lifelong commitment to faithfulness, honor, and mutual support.

**(5) Registration of the Marriage.**
    (a) Upon the completion of the ceremony, the Marriage License shall be signed by the two parties, the Authorized Officiant, and the two witnesses.
    (b) It is the binding legal duty of the Authorized Officiant to submit the signed license to the state for official registration within thirty (30) days of the ceremony.
    (c) Once registered, this document, herein referred to as the **"Certificate of Marriage,"** shall serve as the permanent and conclusive legal proof of the covenant.

**(6) Prohibited Degrees of Kinship.** A marriage is prohibited, and any such purported union is void from its inception, if the two parties are related as:
    (a) a parent and child;
    (b) a grandparent and grandchild;
    (c) a brother and sister, whether by whole blood, half-blood, or adoption; or
    (d) an uncle and niece, or an aunt and nephew.

**(e) Permitted Degrees of Kinship.** For greater clarity, marriage between cousins, whether first or second, is not prohibited by the state. The assessment of the prudence of such a union is a matter of private conscience and familial counsel, not of law.

The list of prohibited relationships in this section is exhaustive. The state shall make no law prohibiting marriage between persons related by any degree of kinship not explicitly forbidden herein.

---

### ARTICLE IV: THE AGE OF MARITAL COVENANT

**(1) Principle of Covenantal Maturity.** The state recognizes that the sacred covenant of Marriage, being a lifelong commitment, requires a foundation of spiritual, emotional, and practical maturity. The laws governing the age of entry into this covenant are designed to uphold this high standard.

**(2) The Age of Full Autonomy.** A person who has reached the age of eighteen (18) years is deemed to possess the maturity to enter into the covenant of Marriage on their own authority and consent. No other party's consent is required.

**(3) The Age of Familial Consent.** A person who has reached the age of sixteen (16) or seventeen (17) years may enter into the covenant of Marriage, subject to the following strict and non-negotiable conditions:

    (a) **Parental Consent.** They must have the formal, written consent of their legal parent(s) or guardian(s), according to the following order of precedence:

        (i) The consent of both parents is required if they are living and retain their parental rights.
        (ii) If one parent is deceased or has had their parental rights formally terminated by a court of law, the consent of the sole remaining parent is sufficient.
        (iii) In extraordinary circumstances where parental consent is impossible to obtain or is being manifestly and unreasonably withheld in a manner contrary to the child's well-being, the parties may petition the eldership of their recognized religious body, or a local council of respected community members as shall be defined by law, to provide the formal consent in place of the parents.
    
    (b) **The Peer Proximity Rule.** The age difference between the two parties entering into the marriage shall not exceed two (2) years. For the purpose of this Act, this condition is met if the difference in their dates of birth does not exceed **seven hundred and thirty-one (731) days**.
    (c) **The Covenant of Familial Support.** The marriage is conditional upon the execution of a legally binding **Covenant of Familial Support** as defined in **Article V** of this Act.

**(4) Absolute Prohibition.** The solemnization of a marriage is absolutely and irrevocably prohibited where either party is under the age of sixteen (16) years. Any such purported union is void from its inception, and any person who knowingly officiates or facilitates such a union is guilty of a serious offense, the penalties for which shall be established in the **Foundations of the Criminal Law Act**.

---

### ARTICLE V: THE COVENANT OF FAMILIAL SUPPORT

**(1) Principle and Purpose.** For a marriage entered into where one or both parties are under the age of eighteen (18), the state recognizes that the union is not an act of individual autonomy, but a covenantal act of one or more families joining to sponsor, guide, and support a new household. This support shall be formalized through a legally binding Covenant of Familial Support.

**(2) Mandatory Prerequisite.** The issuance of a Marriage License for any couple where at least one party is under the age of eighteen (18) is conditional upon the submission of a signed and witnessed Covenant of Familial Support to the state.

**(3) Sponsoring Parties.** The Covenant must be signed by the marrying couple and by the Sponsoring Party. The Sponsoring Party may consist of:
    (a) At least one parent from each family; or
    (b) Both parents from one family, who agree to sponsor the new household in its entirety.

**(4) Commitments of the Covenant.** The Covenant of Familial Support shall contain two distinct parts: a Statement of Covenantal Intent and the Core Legal Commitments.

    (a) **Statement of Covenantal Intent.** By executing this Covenant, the sponsoring parents publicly and solemnly affirm their moral and spiritual commitment to provide guidance, mentorship, and support to the new couple in fulfilling the responsibilities of the marital covenant and the practical management of a household. This statement is a matter of honor and sacred duty, and shall not be subject to judicial enforcement.
    (b) **Core Legal Commitments.** By executing this Covenant, the sponsoring parents legally bind themselves, jointly and severally, to act as **Financial Guarantors** for the new household until the Covenant dissolves. The couple may not enter into any single contract or line of credit exceeding **ten percent (10%) of the most recently published annual National Median Individual Income** without the explicit co-signature of a sponsoring parent. The sponsoring parents shall be held liable for any such co-signed debts upon which the couple defaults.

**(5) Transitional Legal Status of the New Household.** Upon marriage, the couple shall be deemed a new and legally distinct household. They shall have all the rights and responsibilities of a married couple with respect to each other and their children. However, in their financial and contractual dealings with third parties, their legal agency shall be shared with the sponsoring parents as defined herein.

**(6) Dissolution of the Covenant and Lingering Obligations.**

    (a) The Covenant of Familial Support shall automatically and permanently dissolve on the day that the younger of the two spouses reaches the age of eighteen (18) years. At that moment, the married couple becomes a fully and legally independent household, and the Sponsoring Party is released from all **future** obligations under this Covenant.
    (b) For greater clarity, the dissolution of the Covenant does not extinguish the liability of the sponsoring parents for any specific debt or contract that they explicitly co-signed during the term of the Covenant. Their obligation as guarantor for those specific debts shall continue until such debts are fully satisfied according to their terms.

---

### ARTICLE VI: THE DISSOLUTION OF THE MARRIAGE COVENANT

**(1) Principle of Covenantal Permanence and Gravity.** The state affirms that the covenant of Marriage is instituted for life. The dissolution of this covenant is a matter of profound gravity and a last resort, to be permitted only under the strict and exceptional circumstances defined in the **Core Immutable Principles** and implemented herein.

**(2) Exclusive Grounds for Petition.** A court may only hear and grant a petition for the civil dissolution of a marriage on one of the following, and only the following, grounds:

    (a) **Marital Unfaithfulness.** For the purposes of this Act, Marital Unfaithfulness is defined as the commission of sexual intercourse by one spouse with a person other than their spouse.
    (b) **Willful Desertion,** which is defined as either:

        (i) **Physical Desertion:** The deliberate and unjustified abandonment of the marital household by one spouse for a continuous period of no less than one year, with the clear intent to end the marital union.
        (ii) **Constructive Desertion:** A severe and persistent pattern of conduct by one spouse that demonstrates a profound and unrepentant abandonment of their sacred marital duties, rendering continued cohabitation physically unsafe or morally intolerable for the innocent spouse. For greater clarity, such conduct includes, but is not limited to, a documented pattern of physical violence, the commission of a criminal sexual offense against the innocent spouse or a child of the household, or a habitual addiction that leads to the destitution and endangerment of the family.

**(3) Absolute Prohibition on No-Fault Dissolution.** Pursuant to the **Core Immutable Principles**, the creation of "no-fault" divorce is forever prohibited. A petition for dissolution shall not be granted on the basis of mutual consent, "irreconcilable differences," or any other ground not explicitly enumerated in Section (2) of this Article.

**(4) The Legal Process for Dissolution.**

    (a) **Burden of Proof:** The burden of proving the existence of the grounds for dissolution shall, in all cases, rest exclusively upon the spouse filing the petition. The grounds must be proven to the court by a standard of **clear and convincing evidence.**
    (a) **Mandatory Period of Reconciliation.** Upon the filing of a petition for dissolution, a mandatory **"Period of Reconciliation"** of one hundred and eighty (180) days shall commence, during which a final decree of dissolution may not be issued.
        (i) **Protective Orders.** Notwithstanding the foregoing, the petitioning spouse may, at the time of filing, request that the court issue a **Temporary Protective Order** for the duration of this period. Such an order may grant the petitioning spouse exclusive use of the marital home, establish temporary custody of children, and prohibit the other spouse from contacting or approaching them.
        (ii) The state may, by law, establish and fund programs for voluntary, state-encouraged reconciliation counseling, but no party shall be compelled to attend.
    (c) **Final Decree.** If, upon the conclusion of the Period of Reconciliation, the petitioning spouse still wishes to proceed and the court is satisfied that the grounds have been proven, the court shall issue a **Final Decree of Dissolution**, which legally terminates the marriage covenant.

**(5) Matters Consequent to Dissolution.**

    (a) **Division of Property.** Upon dissolution, the court shall provide for a just and equitable division of the marital property and assets. In making this determination, the court is authorized to consider the principle of **Covenant Faithfulness** and may take into account the conduct of the parties which led to the dissolution of the marriage, particularly in cases of financial dissipation or abuse.
    (a) **Care and Custody of Children.** In all matters concerning the children of the marriage, the court's sole and governing standard shall be the **best interest of the individual child.** The court shall issue orders for custody, parental access, and financial support for the children based on this principle alone.

### ARTICLE VII: PARENTAL RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES

**(1) The Principle of Derived Authority.** The state recognizes that the authority of parents over their children is not a right granted by the state, but is a sacred and natural duty delegated to them by God. The state's role is to protect this pre-existing authority, not to create or limit it, except in the most extreme circumstances.

**(2) The Scope of Parental Authority.** Parents are vested with the exclusive right and solemn responsibility to direct every aspect of their child's upbringing until the age of legal majority. This authority includes, but is not limited to, making all decisions concerning their child's:

    (a) Moral and Religious Instruction.
    (b) Education: Choosing the manner, method, and content of their child's education.
    (c) Healthcare.
    (d) Discipline within the home.

**(3) The State's Limited Jurisdiction to Intervene.** Pursuant to **Article 3, Section 5 of the Core Immutable Principles**, the state's authority to intervene in the family's jurisdiction is an extraordinary measure, to be used only as a last resort and limited to the following, and only the following, exhaustive grounds:

    (a) **To Prevent Imminent Physical Harm.** The state may intervene upon a showing of clear and convincing evidence that a child is the victim of physical abuse, abandonment, or profound neglect that poses a direct and imminent threat to their life or physical health.
    (b) **To Remedy Profound Educational Neglect.** The state may intervene upon a showing of clear and convincing evidence of a demonstrable and persistent failure by the parents to provide a child with a foundational education in the core skills of literacy and numeracy.
        (i) **The National Standard of Foundational Competency.** For the purposes of this Act, "profound educational neglect" is legally defined as the state in which a child, by the age of fourteen (14), is demonstrably unable to meet the minimum, objective standards for functional literacy and numeracy as established in the **National Standard of Foundational Competency.**
        (ii) **Establishment of the Standard.** The independent office of the **Chief Statistician of Canada** is hereby mandated to develop, maintain, and publish the National Standard of Foundational Competency. This standard shall consist of a simple, skills-based assessment of functional literacy and numeracy only, and shall contain no material related to any other academic subject, social value, or political worldview.
        (iii) **Limitation on State Authority.** This jurisdiction does not grant the state any authority to dictate curriculum, to compel a specific method of instruction, or to interfere with the moral or religious instruction provided by the parents. The state's authority is limited to remedying a persistent failure to meet the objective National Standard.

**(4) Procedural Safeguards and the Primacy of Family Preservation.**

    (a) Any intervention by the state under the authority of this Article requires a formal order from a court of law, which may only be issued after a child has been assessed by a neutral third party and found not to meet the National Standard.
    (b) The temporary or permanent removal of a child from their parents' custody is the most extreme act of state power and shall not be ordered unless the court finds, beyond a reasonable doubt, that it is the only possible means of protecting the child from imminent death or grievous bodily harm.
    (c) In all proceedings, the primary goal of the court shall be the preservation and reunification of the family.

**(5) The Parental Right of Moral Dissociation.**

    (a) **Principle and Purpose.** While the state is prohibited from discriminating in its employment practices, it is also prohibited from compelling a child to receive instruction in a manner that violates the primary moral authority of their parents. This section establishes a parent's right to shield their child from specific classroom instruction that the parent, in good faith, believes to be a direct and substantial contradiction to the moral and religious instruction provided in the home.

    (b) **Initiation of the Right.** A parent may invoke this right by submitting a formal, written **"Declaration of Moral Dissociation"** to the school administration. This declaration must:
        (i) Name the specific teacher and the subject of instruction.
        (ii) Articulate the parent's sincere and specific objection, based on their religious or moral convictions.
        (iii) Be a request for alternative instruction for the child, not a demand for the removal or discipline of the teacher.

    (c) **The School's Mandatory Duty to Accommodate.** Upon receipt of a valid Declaration, the school administration has a mandatory and non-discretionary duty to provide the child with an alternative means of receiving the academic content for that specific course. The school's duty to accommodate shall be fulfilled by one of the following methods, in order of preference:

        (i) **Transfer:** If another teacher of the same subject is available at the school, the child shall be immediately transferred to that teacher's class for that subject.
        (ii) **Alternative Instruction:** If a transfer is not possible (e.g., in a school with only one teacher for that subject), the school shall provide the parent with the complete, official curriculum, including all necessary textbooks and materials for that course. The school shall then administer all standardized tests and examinations to the child to ensure academic proficiency is met. In this arrangement, the school provides the academic content, and the parent provides the direct instruction in a manner consistent with their moral framework.

    (d) **Limitations and Protections.**
        (i) This right applies to the child and the parent; it confers no right to disrupt the classroom for other students or to harass the teacher in question.
        (ii) The teacher's employment status, compensation, and professional standing shall not be negatively affected in any way by a parent's decision to exercise this right.
        (iii) A parent may not use this right frivolously. A pattern of declarations deemed by the school administration to be a bad-faith attempt to withdraw a child from all instruction shall be grounds for a review under the "Profound Educational Neglect" standard of this Act.

**(6) The Mandatory Protection Standard for Persons with Authority over Minors.**

    (a) **Principle and Scope.** The state has a supreme and non-delegable duty to protect minors from demonstrable threats of harm. This standard shall apply to **every institution, whether public or private**, that exercises authority or provides care for persons under the age of eighteen.

    (b) **The Mandate.** No institution shall grant any adult unsupervised authority over a minor until that person has undergone and cleared a standardized background check, herein named the **Minors & Vulnerable Persons Check**, and has been issued a formal **Clearance Certificate**.

    (c) **The "Minors & Vulnerable Persons Check".** The office of the Provincial Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) shall administer this check, which shall consist of a comprehensive review of all criminal records to identify any charge or conviction that demonstrates a pattern of behavior posing a potential risk to the well-being of a minor. This includes, but is not limited to, offenses involving violence, sexual misconduct, cruelty, and profound dishonesty.

    (d) **Disqualifying Offenses.**
        (i) **Absolute Bar for Heinous Acts:** A Clearance Certificate shall be permanently and irrevocably denied to any person who has a final conviction for an act that constitutes a **Sovereign Offense** as defined in the **Core Immutable Principles**. This absolute bar applies regardless of the jurisdiction or the date of the conviction, and includes any "Equivalent Offense" committed prior to the enactment of this Act. It shall also apply to any person who, having been convicted of a Sovereign Offense, is subsequently released from custody by an act of Executive Clemency.
        (ii) **Discretionary Bar:** For all other relevant offenses, the DPP's office shall have the authority to deny a certificate based on the nature, severity, and pattern of criminal behavior. A denial of a certificate under this clause may be appealed to a court of law.

    (e) **Renewal and Continuing Duty.**
        (i) A Clearance Certificate shall be valid for no more than **three (3) years**.
        (ii) Any person holding a certificate has a binding **duty to self-report** any new, potentially disqualifying charge within seventy-two (72) hours.
        (iii) Any institution has a **duty to inquire** and report credible information about a certificate holder to the DPP's office.

    (f) **Enforcement and Liability.**
        (i) Knowingly falsifying information to obtain a certificate or violating the duty to self-report is a serious criminal offense.
        (ii) An institution that fails in its duty to ensure all relevant personnel have a valid Clearance Certificate shall be subject to severe financial penalties and may be held **civilly liable for gross negligence** in the event a child is harmed.

---

### ARTICLE VIII: ADOPTION AND GUARDIANSHIP

**(1) The Principle of Covenantal Adoption.** The state recognizes adoption as the full and complete grafting of a child into a new family. A legally adopted child shall, for all purposes of law, be considered the natural child of the adopting parents, possessing the same rights, privileges, and duties, including all rights of inheritance. The legal bond with the biological parents shall be permanently and irrevocably severed.

**(2) The Standard for Adoption.**

    (a) **The Covenantal Ideal.** The state affirms that the ideal and preferred environment for the raising of a child is a stable, loving, and permanent household founded upon the covenant of Marriage, which provides the child with both a father and a mother. The court shall, in all adoption proceedings, give primary and preferential consideration to placing a child in such a household.
    (b) **The Best Interest of the Child.** Notwithstanding the foregoing, the ultimate and governing standard in all adoption proceedings shall be the **best interest of the individual child.** Where a placement in a married household is not available or suitable, the court is authorized to place a child for adoption with a single individual, provided the court makes a formal finding that the individual is of exceptional character and is uniquely capable of providing a stable, loving, and permanent home that will serve the child's best interest.

**(3) The Inheritance of Parental Authority (Guardianship).**

    (a) **Parental Prerogative.** Recognizing that parents have the primary authority to determine their child's future, a parent may, in a legally executed will or other formal declaration, nominate a **Guardian** to assume their parental rights and responsibilities in the event of their death.
    (b) **The Court's Limited Role.** Upon the death of the parents, the court's role is to formally and swiftly ratify the parents' chosen Guardian, unless there is clear and convincing evidence that the nominated Guardian is manifestly unfit or unable to care for the child.
    (c) **Default Succession.** In the event that the parents die without having nominated a Guardian, the court shall grant guardianship according to a legally established order of precedence, which shall prioritize the closest and most suitable family members before considering any other party. The Legislature shall, by statute, establish this detailed order of succession.

**(4) Protection of the Orphan and Prohibition on State Parenthood.**

    (a) The state affirms that the primary duty to care for the orphan rests with the extended family, the church, and the local community, in accordance with the virtues of the **National Covenant.**
    (b) The creation of a permanent, state-run foster care or orphanage system, wherein a child is a legal ward of the state, is irrevocably prohibited.
    (c) The state's authority is limited to assuming temporary emergency custody of a child for the sole and urgent purpose of placing that child into a permanent home with their legal Guardian or with a lawfully approved adoptive family. During any such transitional period, the state shall seek to place the child in the temporary, protective care of a private household certified by the court for this charitable purpose.

---

### ARTICLE IX: GENERAL PROVISIONS

**(1) Framework Act Status and Supremacy.** This Act is a **Framework Act** as defined in the **Constitution of Government**. Its provisions are subordinate only to the **Core Immutable Principles** and the **Constitution of Government**. In the event of a conflict between a provision of this Act and a provision of any other ordinary statute, the provisions of this Act shall prevail.

**(2) Severability.** If any article, section, or provision of this Act is declared by the Supreme Court of Canada to be unconstitutional or otherwise invalid, such a finding shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of this Act. The remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect as if the invalid portion had never been enacted.

**(3) Application to Pre-existing Unions.** Any marriage lawfully entered into prior to the enactment of this Act shall be deemed to be a valid and subsisting marriage under the laws of the nation. However, any legal proceeding concerning such a marriage initiated after this Act comes into force, including proceedings for dissolution or matters of child custody, shall be governed exclusively by the provisions of this Act.

**(4) Mandate for Subsequent Legislation.** The Legislature is hereby directed to enact, with all deliberate speed, the ordinary statutes necessary to implement the full provisions of this Act, including but not limited to, the detailed order of succession for guardianship as required by **Article VIII, Section (3)(c)**.

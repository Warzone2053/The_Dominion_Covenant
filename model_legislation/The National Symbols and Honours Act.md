# The National Symbols and Honours Act

---

### PREAMBLE

WHEREAS the soul of a nation is expressed in its symbols, and its character is revealed in the virtues it chooses to honor;

AND WHEREAS the establishment of a common flag, anthem, and coat of arms serves as a perpetual and unifying affirmation of the nation's sovereignty, its distinct identity, and its covenantal bond under God;

AND WHEREAS the **National Covenant** calls the people to a life of virtue, and a just system of national honors is the proper means by which the state may recognize and celebrate those citizens who have, by their exceptional service, sacrifice, or charity, given life to these national ideals;

AND WHEREAS the **Constitution of Government** vests the office of the Governor General with the solemn duty to act as the fount of all national honors, thereby ensuring that such recognition remains above partisan politics and reflects the enduring dignity of the nation itself;

NOW THEREFORE, this Legislature enacts the following law to codify the symbols of the nation, to establish a permanent and honorable system for their display and use, and to create the orders, decorations, and medals by which the nation shall recognize its most worthy citizens.

### ARTICLE I: PURPOSE AND FOUNDATIONAL PRINCIPLES

**Section 1: Short Title**

(1) This Act may be cited as **The National Symbols and Honours Act**.

**Section 2: Purpose and Scope**

(1) The purpose of this Act is to:
    (a) Legally define and establish the official symbols of the nation, including the National Flag, the Coat of Arms, and the National Anthem.
    (b) Establish the proper protocols for the display and use of these national symbols, ensuring they are treated with the dignity and respect they are due.
    (c) Create the official system of national honors, decorations, and medals.
    (d) Affirm the exclusive authority of the Governor General as the fount of all honors and establish the Chancellery responsible for its administration.

**Section 3: The Principle of Symbolic Integrity**

(1) The national symbols are not mere decorations, but are the sacred, visual representations of the nation's covenantal identity. Their meaning is derived directly from the foundational charters, and they shall be interpreted and displayed in a manner consistent with the principles contained therein.

**Section 4: The Principle of Meritorious Honour**

(1) A national honour is the highest recognition the nation can bestow upon a citizen. It shall be awarded solely on the basis of merit, for acts of exceptional valour, profound charity, or distinguished service that manifestly embody the virtues articulated in the **National Covenant**.

(2) No honour shall be granted for reasons of political patronage, wealth, or public notoriety. The system of honors exists to elevate virtue, not to reward status.

### PART I: THE DOMINION ELECTORAL COMMISSION

**Section 1: Establishment**

(1) There is hereby established an independent, non-partisan agency of the Legislature to be known as the Dominion Electoral Commission ("the Commission").

(2) The Commission is responsible for the fair and impartial administration of this Act and the overall conduct of all federal elections.

### PART II: THE ELECTORAL PROCESS

**Section 4: Voter Eligibility**

A person is entitled to vote in an electoral district if they are:
(a) a citizen of Canada;
(b) eighteen years of age or older on the day of the vote; and
(c) a resident of that electoral district.

**Section 5: The National Register of Voters**

(1) The Commission shall maintain a permanent, continuously updated National Register of Voters.

(2) To ensure maximum participation, the Commission shall establish a system of automatic voter registration, using data lawfully provided by other government agencies responsible for taxation, public health, and vital statistics.

(3) Any eligible citizen not captured by the automatic registration process shall have the right to register manually at any time up to and including the day of the vote.

**Section 6: The Voting System**

(1) Pursuant to the constitutional requirement for majority support, all elections for the House of Commons shall be conducted using a **Ranked-Choice Voting** system, also known as an Instant-Runoff Vote.

(2) The ballot shall allow voters to rank candidates in order of preference (1st, 2nd, 3rd, and so on).

(3) The counting process shall proceed as follows:
    (a) **First Count:** All first-preference votes are counted. If a candidate receives more than fifty percent (50%) of the first-preference votes, they are declared the winner.
    (b) **Subsequent Counts:** If no candidate wins on the first count, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated. The ballots cast for the eliminated candidate are then redistributed to the voter's next highest-ranked preference.
    (c) This process of eliminating the last-place candidate and redistributing their votes continues until one candidate has secured a majority of the remaining votes. That candidate is then declared the winner.

(4) In the event that two or more candidates are tied for the fewest votes during an elimination count, the tie shall be broken by eliminating the candidate who had the lower vote total in the immediately preceding round of counting. If the tie persists through all previous rounds, the tie shall be broken by a publicly witnessed lot.

### PART III: CANDIDATE AND CAMPAIGN REGULATIONS

**Section 7: Candidate Registration and Ballot Access**

(1) Pursuant to **Article VII, Section 1, Clause 4(b) of the Constitution of Government**, a citizen shall be registered as a candidate for the House of Commons in an electoral district upon the submission of a formal application to the Commission.

(2) This application must be accompanied by a petition containing the verifiable signatures of no fewer than five hundred (500) electors residing within that electoral district.

(3) The Commission shall establish a formal process for verifying the authenticity of the signatures and the eligibility of the electors.

(4) In accordance with the principle of **Ballot Neutrality**, the final ballot shall list only the candidate's name and their city or town of residence within the district. No affiliation with any political party, association, organization, or informal caucus shall appear on the ballot.

**Section 8: Campaign Finance: Contributions**

(1) Only individual citizens of Canada may contribute to a candidate's campaign. Contributions from corporations, trade unions, associations, and any foreign source are strictly prohibited.

(2) The maximum amount an individual citizen may contribute to any one candidate during an election cycle shall be **one percent (1%) of the national median individual income** from the previous year.

(3) The total aggregate amount an individual citizen may contribute to all candidates combined during an election cycle shall be **two percent (2%) of the national median individual income** from the previous year.

(4) All contributions must be made directly to the candidate's officially registered campaign committee. Anonymous contributions exceeding one hundred dollars are prohibited.

**Section 9: Campaign Finance: Expenditures and Disclosure**

(1) The total expenditures for the purpose of promoting the election of a candidate shall not exceed **one hundred and fifty percent (150%) of the total annual compensation for a member of the House of Commons**. This all-inclusive limit applies to all sources of funds, including, but not limited to, contributions from citizens and the candidate’s personal assets. It governs all spending by the candidate’s registered campaign committee, by the candidate themselves, or by any agent acting on their behalf.

(2) Every candidate shall maintain a public and continuously updated register of all contributions received over one hundred dollars, including the full name and city of residence of the contributor. The Commission shall publish this information on a central public website in real-time.

(3) Within ninety days following an election, every candidate shall submit a full and audited financial statement to the Commission, which shall be made permanently available to the public.

**Section 10: Prohibition of Independent Expenditures**

(1) To ensure the integrity of the contribution and spending limits, it is prohibited for any person or group, other than a candidate's registered campaign committee, to make independent expenditures on any public communication that promotes, supports, attacks, or opposes a specific candidate.

(2) A communication is presumed to be a prohibited independent expenditure if it is distributed during the official election period and mentions a candidate by name or unambiguous reference.

(3) This prohibition shall not be construed to limit the right of any person or media organization to publish news reporting, editorials, or personal commentary that is not coordinated, directly or indirectly, with any candidate's campaign.

**Section 11: Enforcement and Penalties**

(1) The Dominion Electoral Commission is granted the authority to investigate any alleged violation of the provisions of this Part.

(2) Any person who knowingly violates the contribution limits, expenditure limits, or the prohibition on third-party campaigning is guilty of a hybrid offence.
    (a) For individuals, this is punishable by a fine of up to five times the amount of the illicit contribution or expenditure, or imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years, or both.
    (b) For any director of a corporation or officer of a group that violates these provisions, they shall be held personally liable to the same penalties.

(3) Any candidate whose campaign committee is found to have knowingly and substantially violated these provisions shall be subject to severe penalties, including disqualification from the election, forfeiture of office if elected, and ineligibility to run for public office for a period of ten years.

(4) The Commission shall establish a schedule of administrative penalties for minor violations of this Part that are found to be unintentional or not part of a systematic attempt to circumvent the law. For such minor violations, the Commission may issue fines or require the disgorgement of funds in lieu of pursuing criminal prosecution or disqualification. The decision to pursue administrative penalties or criminal charges rests solely with the Commission.

### PART IV: VOTING OPERATIONS AND BALLOT INTEGRITY

**Section 12: The Ballot**

(1) All voting shall be conducted using official paper ballots produced by the Commission. Electronic-only voting machines are prohibited.

(2) Each ballot shall be printed on secure paper and shall contain a unique, non-sequential serial number.

(3) The ballot shall be designed with a perforated, detachable stub that also contains the serial number.

**Section 13: Polling Stations and Staff**

(1) The Commission shall establish a sufficient number of polling stations in each electoral district to ensure reasonable and equitable access for all voters.

(2) All polling station staff shall be recruited, trained, and compensated directly by the Commission. To ensure impartiality, staff shall, wherever practicable, be assigned to polling stations outside of their own home precinct.

(3) Each registered candidate shall be entitled to appoint one accredited, non-interfering observer to be present at each polling station within their electoral district.

**Section 14: The Voting Process**

(1) Upon arriving at the polling station, an elector shall present a single piece of government-issued photo identification to a poll worker to verify their identity.
    (a) An elector who is unable to present the required identification shall not be prevented from voting. They shall be issued a Provisional Ballot and a Provisional Ballot Security Envelope.
    (b) The elector shall mark the Provisional Ballot, place it inside the Security Envelope, and seal it. The elector must then sign their name and write their residential address and date of birth on the outside of the Security Envelope.
    (c) The polling official shall witness the signature and place the sealed Security Envelope into a separate, designated container for provisional ballots.
    (d) Following the election, the Commission shall verify the information provided on the outside of each Security Envelope against official government records. A Provisional Ballot shall only be opened and counted if the Commission can positively confirm the elector's identity and their eligibility to have voted in that electoral district.

(2) Once an elector's identity is verified, a poll worker shall cross the elector's name off the voting list.

(3) A second poll worker shall then issue a ballot to the elector, and shall tear off the perforated stub, depositing the stub into a separate container for ballot accounting purposes.

(4) The elector shall mark their anonymous ballot in a private voting booth and shall personally deposit it into the official ballot box.

**Section 15: Processing of Absentee Ballots**

(1) **Stage One: Pre-Processing and Verification.** The Commission shall, upon receipt of absentee ballots, begin the pre-processing of the security envelopes. This process may begin up to fourteen days before election day and shall involve:
    (a) Verifying the voter's signature on the outside of the security envelope against the official record on file.
    (b) Confirming that the elector has not already voted in person.
    (c) If the signature and eligibility are verified, the security envelope is marked as "Accepted."

(2) **Separation for Secrecy.** Once an envelope is accepted, the anonymous inner ballot envelope shall be removed and placed into a sealed, secure container with all other accepted anonymous ballots. The outer security envelope, which contains the voter's signature, shall be stored separately. This step must be performed in a manner that ensures the absolute anonymity of the enclosed ballot.

(3) **Rejected Ballots.** If an absentee ballot is rejected due to a non-matching signature or other issue, the Commission shall make a reasonable effort to notify the elector and provide them with an opportunity to cure the defect up until the close of polls on election day.

(4) **Stage Two: Tabulation.** The secure containers of accepted anonymous ballots shall remain sealed and shall not be opened or tabulated until after the close of all polls on election day. At that time, they shall be opened and counted in the same manner as regular ballots.

**Section 16: Chain of Custody**

(1) At the close of voting, all ballot boxes shall be sealed with a uniquely numbered, tamper-evident seal.

(2) The seal number, the number of ballots issued, and the number of unused ballots shall be recorded in an official logbook. This log shall be signed by the chief polling official and may be co-signed by the accredited observers present.

(3) The sealed ballot boxes and the official logbook shall be transported directly from the polling station to their designated regional counting facility by no fewer than two designated Commission officials.

**Section 17: Regional and Transparent Counting**

(1) To ensure both security and efficiency, all ballots shall be counted at secure **regional counting facilities** established by the Commission. There shall be, wherever practicable, at least one such facility per electoral district.
    (a) The Commission may establish a single facility for multiple, geographically concentrated urban districts, or a single facility for a vast, sparsely populated rural region, but must publish the operational justification for any such deviation.

(2) The counting facilities shall be under 24-hour video surveillance, and all stages of the counting process shall be open to observation by accredited candidate representatives.

(3) Ballots may be tabulated using high-speed optical scanners. Any hardware or software used for the tabulation of votes must be owned by the Commission, and all software used must be open-source and publicly auditable. The original paper ballots shall always be preserved and shall constitute the only official record of the vote.

### PART V: CERTIFICATION OF RESULTS AND TIMELINES

**Section 18: Election Night Reporting**

(1) On the night of the election, the Commission shall tabulate and publish the preliminary, unofficial results from the initial count of all regular, in-person ballots.

(2) These results are for informational purposes only and are not binding until the final certification is complete. The Commission shall also publish its best determination of the total number of provisional and absentee ballots that remain to be verified and counted.

**Section 19: The Verification and Counting Period**

(1) Beginning the morning after the election, the Commission shall enter a continuous "Verification and Counting Period," which shall not exceed **seven (7) calendar days**.

(2) During this period, the Commission shall work with all necessary urgency to:
    (a) Verify the eligibility of all provisional ballots.
    (b) Verify the signatures on all absentee ballots.
    (c) Adjudicate any disputed ballots.

(3) To ensure maximum public trust and transparency, the Chief Electoral Officer shall hold a public briefing **no later than 2:00 PM each day** during this period. This briefing shall provide an updated report on the number of ballots verified, accepted, and remaining, and shall include a categorical breakdown of the reasons for any ballots being rejected.

**Section 20: Final Certification and Failure Protocol**

(1) No later than **eight (8) calendar days** following the election, the Chief Electoral Officer shall, having tabulated all accepted regular, provisional, and absentee ballots, formally certify the final result for each electoral district. This certification is the final and official declaration of the winner.

(2) **Failure to Certify Protocol:** If the Chief Electoral Officer fails to certify the results by the constitutional deadline, a state of "Electoral Impasse" is declared. The board of Commissioners (the Auditor General, the Public Tribune General, and the Chief Statistician) shall immediately convene, assume direct command of the final count, and **shall not adjourn until they have publicly certified the final results**. This final certification by the board must be completed within 24 hours of the original deadline.

(3) **State of Electoral Exigency:** If a catastrophic and verifiable event makes the certification deadline physically impossible to meet, the board of Commissioners may, by a unanimous public vote, declare a State of Electoral Exigency. This declaration shall detail the nature of the event and shall grant a single, non-extendable **48-hour extension** to the final certification deadline. This power may not be used to compensate for administrative delay or incompetence.

**Section 21: Timelines for Recounts and Audits**

(1) If an automatic recount is triggered under this Act, the eight-day deadline for final certification shall be automatically extended by a final, non-extendable period of **four (4) calendar days**.

(2) The mandatory Risk-Limiting Audit shall be initiated *after* the final certification and must be completed within thirty (30) calendar days of the election.

(3) **The full and detailed report of the Risk-Limiting Audit shall be published immediately upon its completion.**

(4) If the audit reveals a discrepancy that materially questions the certified outcome of the election, the Commission is empowered to petition the Supreme Court of Canada for an order compelling a full manual recount of all ballots and for any other remedy the Court deems just.

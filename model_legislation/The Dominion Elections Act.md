### PART II: THE ELECTORAL PROCESS

**Section 4: Voter Eligibility**

A person is entitled to vote in an electoral district if they are:
(a) a citizen of Canada;
(b) eighteen years of age or older on the day of the vote; and
(c) a resident of that electoral district.

**Section 5: The National Register of Voters**

(1) The Commission shall maintain a permanent, continuously updated National Register of Voters.

(2) To ensure maximum participation, the Commission shall establish a system of automatic voter registration, using data lawfully provided by other government agencies responsible for taxation, public health, and vital statistics.

(3) Any eligible citizen not captured by the automatic registration process shall have the right to register manually at any time up to and including the day of the vote.

**Section 6: The Voting System**

(1) Pursuant to the constitutional requirement for majority support, all elections for the House of Commons shall be conducted using a **Ranked-Choice Voting** system, also known as an Instant-Runoff Vote.

(2) The ballot shall allow voters to rank candidates in order of preference (1st, 2nd, 3rd, and so on).

(3) The counting process shall proceed as follows:
    (a) **First Count:** All first-preference votes are counted. If a candidate receives more than fifty percent (50%) of the first-preference votes, they are declared the winner.
    (b) **Subsequent Counts:** If no candidate wins on the first count, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated. The ballots cast for the eliminated candidate are then redistributed to the voter's next highest-ranked preference.
    (c) This process of eliminating the last-place candidate and redistributing their votes continues until one candidate has secured a majority of the remaining votes. That candidate is then declared the winner.

(4) In the event that two or more candidates are tied for the fewest votes during an elimination count, the tie shall be broken by eliminating the candidate who had the lower vote total in the immediately preceding round of counting. If the tie persists through all previous rounds, the tie shall be broken by a publicly witnessed lot.

### PART III: CANDIDATE AND CAMPAIGN REGULATIONS

**Section 7: Candidate Registration and Ballot Access**

(1) Pursuant to **Article VII, Section 1, Clause 4(b) of the Constitution of Government**, a citizen shall be registered as a candidate for the House of Commons in an electoral district upon the submission of a formal application to the Commission.

(2) This application must be accompanied by a petition containing the verifiable signatures of no fewer than five hundred (500) electors residing within that electoral district.

(3) The Commission shall establish a formal process for verifying the authenticity of the signatures and the eligibility of the electors.

(4) In accordance with the principle of **Ballot Neutrality**, the final ballot shall list only the candidate's name and their city or town of residence within the district. No affiliation with any political party, association, organization, or informal caucus shall appear on the ballot.

**Section 8: Campaign Finance: Contributions**

(1) Only individual citizens of Canada may contribute to a candidate's campaign. Contributions from corporations, trade unions, associations, and any foreign source are strictly prohibited.

(2) The maximum amount an individual citizen may contribute to any one candidate during an election cycle shall be **one percent (1%) of the national median individual income** from the previous year.

(3) The total aggregate amount an individual citizen may contribute to all candidates combined during an election cycle shall be **two percent (2%) of the national median individual income** from the previous year.

(4) All contributions must be made directly to the candidate's officially registered campaign committee. Anonymous contributions exceeding one hundred dollars are prohibited.

---

**Section 9: Campaign Finance: Expenditures and Disclosure**

(1) The total expenditures for the purpose of promoting the election of a candidate shall not exceed **one hundred and fifty percent (150%) of the total annual compensation for a member of the House of Commons**. This all-inclusive limit applies to all sources of funds, including, but not limited to, contributions from citizens and the candidate’s personal assets. It governs all spending by the candidate’s registered campaign committee, by the candidate themselves, or by any agent acting on their behalf.

(2) Every candidate shall maintain a public and continuously updated register of all contributions received over one hundred dollars, including the full name and city of residence of the contributor. The Commission shall publish this information on a central public website in real-time.

(3) Within ninety days following an election, every candidate shall submit a full and audited financial statement to the Commission, which shall be made permanently available to the public.

---

**Section 10: Prohibition of Independent Expenditures**

(1) To ensure the integrity of the contribution and spending limits, it is prohibited for any person or group, other than a candidate's registered campaign committee, to make independent expenditures on any public communication that promotes, supports, attacks, or opposes a specific candidate.

(2) A communication is presumed to be a prohibited independent expenditure if it is distributed during the official election period and mentions a candidate by name or unambiguous reference.

(3) This prohibition shall not be construed to limit the right of any person or media organization to publish news reporting, editorials, or personal commentary that is not coordinated, directly or indirectly, with any candidate's campaign.

---

**Section 11: Enforcement and Penalties**

(1) The Dominion Electoral Commission is granted the authority to investigate any alleged violation of the provisions of this Part.

(2) Any person who knowingly violates the contribution limits, expenditure limits, or the prohibition on third-party campaigning is guilty of a hybrid offence.
    (a) For individuals, this is punishable by a fine of up to five times the amount of the illicit contribution or expenditure, or imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years, or both.
    (b) For any director of a corporation or officer of a group that violates these provisions, they shall be held personally liable to the same penalties.

(3) Any candidate whose campaign committee is found to have knowingly and substantially violated these provisions shall be subject to severe penalties, including disqualification from the election, forfeiture of office if elected, and ineligibility to run for public office for a period of ten years.

(4) The Commission shall establish a schedule of administrative penalties for minor violations of this Part that are found to be unintentional or not part of a systematic attempt to circumvent the law. For such minor violations, the Commission may issue fines or require the disgorgement of funds in lieu of pursuing criminal prosecution or disqualification. The decision to pursue administrative penalties or criminal charges rests solely with the Commission.

# The Citizenship and National Allegiance Act

---

### PREAMBLE

WHEREAS the Dominion Covenant establishes a nation founded upon a shared commitment to enduring moral principles and a common allegiance to its foundational charters;

AND WHEREAS citizenship in such a nation is not merely a right of residency, but is a solemn status that signifies a person's entry into this covenantal bond, with all the rights and responsibilities that it entails;

AND WHEREAS it is necessary to establish a clear, just, and dignified process by which individuals acquire this status, and to define the fundamental duties that flow from it;

NOW THEREFORE, this Legislature enacts the following law to govern the acquisition, the privileges, and the duties of citizenship within the nation.

### ARTICLE I: PURPOSE AND FOUNDATIONAL PRINCIPLES

**(1) Short Title.** This Act may be cited as **The Citizenship and National Allegiance Act**.

**(2) Purpose.** The purpose of this Act is to:
    (a) Define the exclusive means by which a person may acquire citizenship.
    (b) Affirm the fundamental rights and privileges reserved for citizens.
    (c) Codify the core duties and responsibilities that are inseparable from those rights.
    (d) Establish the limited and extraordinary circumstances under which citizenship may be lost.

**(3) The Principle of Covenantal Citizenship.** The state recognizes citizenship as a sacred bond between the individual and the nation, founded upon a mutual and binding allegiance to the **Core Immutable Principles** and the **Constitution of Government**. It is a status to be earned and maintained through faithfulness to this covenant.

### ARTICLE II: THE ACQUISITION OF CITIZENSHIP

**(1) Citizenship by Birth.** A person is a citizen of the nation by birth if, at the time of their birth, at least one of their parents is a citizen. For greater clarity, the mere fact of being born within the sovereign territory of the nation to parents who are not citizens does not, in itself, confer citizenship.

**(2) Citizenship by Naturalization.** A non-citizen who is a legal resident of the nation may petition the state to be granted citizenship through naturalization. The process shall be a formal and deliberate one, designed to ensure the petitioner is prepared to fully enter into the national covenant.

**(3) Prerequisites for Naturalization.** To be eligible to petition for citizenship, a person must meet all of the following criteria:
    (a) Have been a lawful, permanent resident of the nation for a continuous period of no less than five years.
    (b) Have reached the age of legal majority.
    (c) Be of good moral character, which shall be demonstrated by the absence of any conviction for a serious criminal offense.
    (d) Be economically self-sufficient, and not have been primarily dependent on state-provided welfare for the preceding three years.

**(4) The Covenant Examination.** A petitioner who meets the prerequisites shall be required to pass a formal **Covenant Examination.** The purpose of this examination is to ensure the petitioner is fully prepared to enter into the national covenant. It shall consist of two distinct parts:

    (a) **The Foundational Competency Assessment.** The petitioner must demonstrate their ability to meet the minimum, objective standards for functional literacy and numeracy as established in the **National Standard of Foundational Competency**, the same standard required of all citizens under the **Marriage and Family Covenant Act**.

    (b) **The Civic and Covenantal Knowledge Assessment.** The petitioner must demonstrate a deep and functional understanding of:
        (i) The nation's foundational documents, including the **Core Immutable Principles** and the **Constitution of Government.**
        (ii) The virtues and duties articulated in the **National Covenant.**
        (iii) The rights and responsibilities of a citizen as defined by law.

**(5) The Oath of Allegiance.** The final, indispensable step in becoming a citizen is the swearing of a public and binding **Oath of Allegiance** before an officer of a court of law. Upon the swearing of this oath, and not before, the person is granted all the rights and responsibilities of a citizen. The text of the oath shall be:

> *"Before Almighty God and this assembled nation, I, [Name], do solemnly declare that I have read and understood the foundational charters of this Dominion. I hereby renounce all prior allegiances and pledge my full and undivided loyalty to the **Core Immutable Principles** and the **Constitution of Government of Canada**. I swear to faithfully obey its laws, to fulfill my duties as a citizen, and to defend its sovereignty against all enemies. This I promise without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion. So help me God."*

### ARTICLE III: THE RIGHTS AND DUTIES OF A CITIZEN

**(1) The Rights of a Citizen.** While all persons within the nation are protected by the law, the following core rights are reserved exclusively for citizens:
    (a) The right to vote in any election or referendum.
    (b) The right to hold any elected or appointed public office.
    (c) The right and the duty to fulfill National Service in the **Regulated Militia** or the **National Service Corps**.
    (d) The right to keep and bear arms, as defined in **Article 9 of the Core Immutable Principles**.
    (e) The absolute right to enter, remain in, and leave the nation.

**(2) The Duties of a Citizen.** Citizenship is inseparable from the following core duties:
    (a) The duty of allegiance to the **Core Immutable Principles** and the **Constitution of Government**.
    (b) The duty to obey the just laws of the land.
    (c) The duty to fulfill the term of **National Service** as shall be required by law.
    (d) The duty to serve on a jury when called.
    (e) The duty to participate thoughtfully in the civic life of the nation.

### ARTICLE IV: THE LOSS OF CITIZENSHIP

**(1) Principle of Permanence.** Citizenship, being a covenantal bond, is intended to be permanent and shall not be revoked by the state for light or transient causes.

**(2) Voluntary Renunciation.** A citizen who has reached the age of legal majority may choose to voluntarily and permanently renounce their citizenship by making a formal declaration before a court of law.

**(3) Revocation for Treason.** Citizenship is automatically and irrevocably revoked upon a person's final conviction for the crime of **Treason**, as defined in the **Foundations of the Criminal Law Act**. The commission of treason is deemed to be the ultimate and absolute act of breaking the national covenant. No other crime shall be grounds for the involuntary revocation of citizenship.

---

### ARTICLE V: GENERAL PROVISIONS

**(1) Status of Non-Citizens.** A non-citizen who is a lawful resident of the nation shall be protected by all laws of the land and shall be subject to the jurisdiction of its courts. They shall not, however, possess the political rights or be subject to the core duties, such as National Service, that are reserved for citizens.

**(2) Mandate for Immigration Law.** The Legislature is directed to enact ordinary statutes to govern the process of legal immigration, including the setting of annual quotas and the specific criteria for granting permanent residency. These laws shall be designed to serve the national interest and to ensure the orderly assimilation of new residents.

**(3) Severability.** If any article, section, or provision of this Act is declared by the Supreme Court of Canada to be unconstitutional or otherwise invalid, such a finding shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of this Act.

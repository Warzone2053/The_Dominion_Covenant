# The National Service Act

---

### PREAMBLE

WHEREAS the **Core Immutable Principles** establish a binding obligation for every citizen to render a term of national service for the common defense and well-being of the nation;

AND WHEREAS this service is not merely a legal duty, but is the central, formative experience by which a young person is transformed into a full Citizen, earning the right to participate in the governance of the nation;

AND WHEREAS the state recognizes the complementary vocations of men and women and seeks to structure this rite of passage in a manner that honors these callings;

AND WHEREAS this Act is intended to establish the permanent and binding operational rules for all forms of National Service, and is therefore a **Framework Act** as defined in **Article II of the Constitution of Government**;

NOW THEREFORE, this Legislature enacts the following law to govern the universal service obligation of all citizens.

---

### ARTICLE I: PURPOSE AND PRINCIPLES

**(1) Short Title.** This Act may be cited as **The National Service Act**.

**(2) The Principle of Earned Citizenship.** The honorable completion of a full term of National Service is the final and indispensable prerequisite for the vesting of a citizen's full political rights, including the right to vote and hold public office.

**(3) The Principle of Covenantal Vocation.** The state recognizes that men and women are created with equal dignity but different and complementary callings. The structure of National Service is designed to honor and reinforce these vocations.

### ARTICLE II: THE OBLIGATION FOR MALE CITIZENS

**(1) The Vocation of the Guardian.** Service in the **Regulated Militia** is the presumptive and primary path of National Service for all medically fit male citizens upon reaching the age of majority.

**(2) The Path of Conscience.** A male citizen may petition to fulfill his service obligation in the **National Service Corps** only by being formally recognized as a **Conscientious Objector**.
    (a) **Standard of Proof:** To be granted this status, the petitioner must demonstrate to a judicial panel, by a clear and convincing standard of evidence, a sincere, deeply held, and religiously grounded conviction that prohibits him from participating in any military activity.
    (b) **Consequence of Status:** A citizen recognized as a Conscientious Objector shall, upon completion of his service, be vested with all political rights of a citizen **except for the right to keep and bear arms**. This is the logical consequence of the citizen's own formal declaration of his conscientious opposition to the bearing of arms.

### ARTICLE III: THE OBLIGATION FOR FEMALE CITIZENS

**(1) The Vocation of the Homemaker.** The primary and most vital service a woman renders to the nation is the bearing and raising of the next generation within the covenant of Marriage. This vocation is held to be the highest and most honorable form of national service for a woman.

**(2) Exemption by Vocation.** A female citizen who is married is deemed to be fulfilling her primary service obligation and is exempt from any compulsory state service.

**(3) The Mandate of Charitable Service.** A female citizen who has not entered into the covenant of Marriage by her twenty-sixth birthday shall be required to fulfill a term of **Mandatory Charitable Service**.

    (a) **Term of Service:** The term of service shall commence upon a citizen's twenty-sixth birthday and shall be completed upon the **first to occur** of the following two events: the completion of **one calendar year** of service, or the completion of **eight hundred (800) hours** of service.
    (b) **Minimum Service Requirement:** To ensure diligent participation, a citizen must complete an average of **at least ten (10) hours of service per week**, calculated monthly. A citizen who fails to meet this minimum standard of diligence without just cause shall have her one-year service clock paused until she resumes the required pace.
    (c) **The Two Paths of Honorable Completion:** The state recognizes two levels of honorable completion for this duty:
        (i) **Honorable Completion (Citizen Builder):** A citizen who honorably completes her service by reaching the one-year time limit, having fulfilled the minimum service requirement, shall be recognized as a **Citizen Builder**. She is deemed to have fulfilled her National Service obligation, and her full political rights shall be vested.
        (ii) **Distinguished Completion (Citizen Steward):** A citizen who, through exceptional diligence and commitment, completes the full **eight hundred (800) hours** of service before the one-year time limit is reached shall be recognized as a **Citizen Steward**. She is deemed to have completed her service with distinction.
    (d) **The Steward's Honorarium:** As a mark of national gratitude for her distinguished service, upon completion of her 800 hours, a Citizen Steward shall be granted a one-time, tax-exempt **Steward's Honorarium** by the state. The amount of this honorarium shall be set by statute but shall be a significant sum, intended to assist her in the establishment of a household or the pursuit of further education. This honorarium is not available to those who achieve standard Honorable Completion.
    (e) **The Civic Service Stipend:** All citizens fulfilling this service, regardless of their intended completion path, shall be paid the standard **Civic Service Stipend** for all hours worked. The Steward's Honorarium is a bonus granted upon completion of the higher standard.

### ARTICLE IV: EXEMPTIONS AND EQUIVALENT SERVICE

**(1) Honorable Medical Exemption.** A citizen of either sex who is deemed permanently medically unfit for their respective path of service, according to the uniform National Standard for Service, shall be granted an **Honorable Medical Exemption**.

**(2) Civic Equivalent Service.** A citizen holding this exemption shall be required to complete a term of **Civic Equivalent Service**, consisting of a defined period of volunteer work with a state-recognized Qualified Charitable Organization (QCO).

**(3) Vesting of Full Rights.** Upon honorable completion of Civic Equivalent Service, the citizen shall be vested with all political rights, **including the right to keep and bear arms**, as their inability to serve was a matter of physical capacity, not of conscientious choice.

---

### ARTICLE V: THE NATIONAL SERVICE CORPS

**(1) Mission and Composition.** There is hereby established the **National Service Corps (NSC)**. It shall be composed of male citizens who have been granted Conscientious Objector status.

**(2) Mandate.** The mission of the NSC shall be to undertake projects of national significance that require arduous physical labor, discipline, and teamwork, but which are non-martial in nature. This includes, but is not limited to, large-scale infrastructure projects in remote regions, wilderness conservation, and serving as a primary logistical force during national disasters.

### ARTICLE VI: ADMINISTRATION AND VESTING OF RIGHTS

**(1) Term of Service.** The standard term of service for the Regulated Militia and the National Service Corps shall be two years of full-time service, or an equivalent period of part-time service as shall be defined by statute. The term of service for women is as defined in Article III.

**(2) The National Service Registry.** A national body shall be established to oversee the administration of this Act, maintain a registry of all citizens, and certify the honorable completion of service.

**(3) Vesting of Political Rights.** Upon certification of honorable completion of any of the prescribed paths of service, a citizen's political rights are formally and legally vested. They shall be transferred to the roll of active voters and become eligible to hold public office.

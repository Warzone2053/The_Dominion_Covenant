# The Retribution and Corrections Framework Act

---

### PREAMBLE

WHEREAS the **Core Immutable Principles** establish that the state acts as God's "diakonos," bearing the sword to punish evil and protect the innocent;

AND WHEREAS the virtue of **Justice**, as articulated in the **National Covenant**, demands that a just sentence be proportionate to the depravity of the crime;

AND WHEREAS the commission of certain Sovereign Offenses represents an absolute forfeiture of the right to live in free society;

AND WHEREAS this Act intends to define the conditions of a just and permanent sentence of civil death for those who have committed such Sovereign Offenses;

AND WHEREAS such a sentence, while serving as a powerful denunciation of evil, must not violate the immutable dignity inherent in all persons created in the *Imago Dei*;

AND WHEREAS this Act is intended to establish the permanent and binding operational rules for such sentences, and is therefore a **Framework Act** as defined in **Article II of the Constitution of Government**;

NOW THEREFORE, this Legislature enacts the following law to govern the terms of retribution, confinement, and labor for those justly deprived of their liberty for the remainder of their natural lives.

### ARTICLE I: FOUNDATIONAL PRINCIPLES OF CORRECTIONS

---

#### **Section 1: The Dual Mandate of the Corrections System**

(1) The purpose of the national corrections system is to uphold justice, ensure public safety, and affirm the rule of law by administering sentences in a manner that is proportionate to the offense and consistent with the foundational principles of the nation.

(2) To achieve this purpose, the system shall operate under a dual mandate, recognizing a fundamental distinction between those who have committed Sovereign Offenses and all other offenders:
    (a) **For Sovereign Offenses:** The sole and exclusive mandate is **Retributive Justice**. The sentence for such offenses shall be the permanent removal of the offender from free society through a sentence of **Civil Death**, as defined in **Article III** of this Act. The goal is the absolute protection of the innocent and the just denunciation of ultimate evil. Rehabilitation is not the objective of this sentence.
    (b) **For All Other Offenses:** The primary mandate is **Restorative Justice and Rehabilitation**. The sentence for such offenses shall be designed to secure the offender's repayment of their debt to society, to provide for restitution to victims, and to encourage the offender's reform into a responsible and productive citizen upon their release.

#### **Section 2: The *Imago Dei* Firewall**

(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, it is hereby affirmed that every person, including every incarcerated person, is created in the image of God (*Imago Dei*). While a person may, by their actions, forfeit their right to liberty, they do not forfeit their fundamental human dignity.

(2) Accordingly, all persons employed by or acting as agents of the national corrections system are irrevocably prohibited from engaging in any of the following acts against any person in their custody:
    (a) **Torture,** which is defined as the intentional infliction of severe physical or mental pain or suffering for any reason.
    (b) **Cruelty or Degradation,** which includes any act intended solely to humiliate, torment, or debase a person.
    (c) **Willful Medical Neglect,** which is the deliberate withholding of necessary medical care for a serious health condition.
    (d) The deliberate imposition of **Unsafe or Unsanitary Conditions** that pose a substantial risk of serious harm or disease.

(3) The state has a positive and non-delegable duty to provide every incarcerated person with the necessities of life, which shall include, at minimum:
    (a) Sufficient nutrition and hydration to sustain life and health.
    (b) Adequate shelter and clothing.
    (c) A safe and sanitary living environment.
    (d) Necessary medical, dental, and mental health care.

(4) A violation of the prohibitions in this section by a state agent shall constitute a serious criminal offense, and any official who orders or knowingly permits such a violation shall be held personally liable.

---

### ARTICLE II: THE MINISTRY OF THE WORD AND THE RIGHT TO CONSCIENCE

---

#### **Section 1: The Primacy of the Soul**

(1) The justice administered by the state under this Act is temporal and is limited to the person's earthly life and liberty. The state possesses no authority over the eternal disposition of a person's soul.

(2) The right of every person to seek reconciliation with God is a direct consequence of their creation in the *Imago Dei* and shall not be infringed. While the state may justly punish the body, it is forbidden from creating barriers to the voluntary repentance of the soul.

#### **Section 2: The Right to Counsel and Scripture**

(1) Every incarcerated person, regardless of their sentence, shall have the right to:
    (a) Voluntarily request and receive regular, confidential spiritual counsel from a certified member of the **National Chaplaincy Corps**.
    (b) Possess for their personal use one copy of the Holy Bible.

(2) The Legislature shall, by statute, provide for the establishment of a professional **National Chaplaincy Corps**. To be certified for service, all chaplains must formally subscribe to the foundational theological principles of the **National Covenant**, including the doctrines of the Holy Trinity, the authority of Scripture, and the necessity of repentance.

#### **Section 3: Limitations for Institutional Order**

(1) The exercise of the rights established in this Article shall be conducted in a manner that does not compromise the security, discipline, or specific purpose of the correctional institution.

(2) This Article shall not be construed to create a right to:
    (a) Congregational or group worship services that would violate the security protocols or the standard of austerity applicable to the institution and sentence.
    (b) Proselytize in a manner that is disruptive or coercive to other incarcerated persons or staff.
    (c) Possess any religious object or paraphernalia other than the Holy Bible itself.

(3) All participation in spiritual counsel or study shall be strictly voluntary. No incarcerated person shall be rewarded or punished for their decision to seek or to refuse such counsel. It shall have no bearing on their eligibility for any earned privileges or parole.

---

### ARTICLE III: THE SENTENCE OF CIVIL DEATH

---

#### **Section 1: Definition and Imposition**

(1) The sentence of imprisonment for the full remainder of a person's natural life, without the possibility of parole, shall be known in law as the sentence of **Civil Death**.

(2) This sentence is mandatory and shall be imposed, to the exclusion of all other sentences, upon any person convicted of a **Sovereign Offense** as defined in **Article 1, Section 8 of the Core Immutable Principles** and the **Foundations of the Criminal Law Act**.

#### **Section 2: The Principle of Irrevocability**

(1) A sentence of **Civil Death** is absolute and permanent. A person so sentenced shall not be eligible for parole, statutory release, compassionate release, or any other form of early release for any reason.

(2) The sentence may only be nullified by a conclusive finding of factual innocence or be commuted by the exercise of **Executive Clemency** as prescribed in **Article 1, Section 8(g)(ii) of the Core Immutable Principles**.

#### **Section 3: Forfeiture of Civil and Political Rights**

(1) Upon the imposition of a sentence of **Civil Death**, the convicted person is hereby deemed to have forfeited all rights and privileges of a citizen. All such rights are irrevocably extinguished.

(2) This forfeiture includes, but is not limited to, the right to:
    (a) vote in any municipal, provincial, or national election or referendum;
    (b) hold any public or elected office;
    (c) serve on any jury, whether a Grand Jury, a National Citizen Jury, or a trial jury; and
    (d) keep and bear arms.

#### **Section 4: Extinguishment of Familial and Contractual Rights**

(1) The commission of a **Sovereign Offense** is deemed in law to be an act of ultimate and irremediable desertion of all familial and societal covenants.

(2) Accordingly, upon sentencing:
    (a) The conviction for a Sovereign Offense shall constitute absolute grounds for the dissolution of any existing marriage. The innocent spouse is hereby granted the right to have the marriage declared dissolved by a court upon their sole petition, immediately and without further cause. The choice to exercise this right rests exclusively with the innocent spouse.
    (b) All parental rights held by the convicted person over any minor child are permanently and irrevocably terminated.

#### **Section 5: Disposition of Property and Restitution**

(1) A person sentenced to **Civil Death** is rendered incapable of owning, inheriting, or disposing of property.

(2) All assets and property held by the person at the time of their final conviction shall be liquidated by a court-appointed trustee. The proceeds shall be distributed in the following order of priority:
    (a) First, to satisfy any court-ordered restitution to the victim or the victim's family.
    (b) Second, to reimburse the state for the costs of the person's prosecution and confinement.
    (c) Third, any remaining assets shall be distributed to the person's legal heirs as if the person had died intestate on the day of their sentencing.

#### **Section 6: Limitation of Legal Standing**

(1) A person sentenced to **Civil Death** shall lose all legal standing to initiate or participate in any civil lawsuit in their own right.

(2) This limitation does not extinguish their right to petition a court, with the assistance of counsel, for the sole purposes of:
    (a) challenging the legality of their original conviction and sentence through established appellate or habeas corpus procedures; or
    (b) seeking remedy for a violation of the conditions of their confinement as established in the **Imago Dei Firewall in Article I, Section 2** of this Act.

---

### ARTICLE IV: STANDARDS FOR GENERAL INCARCERATION

---

#### **Section 1: Applicability and Purpose**

(1) The provisions of this Article shall apply to all persons sentenced to a term of imprisonment for any offense that is not a **Sovereign Offense**.

(2) The primary purpose of general incarceration is to serve as a period of **Restorative Justice and Rehabilitation**. The goals of the sentence shall be to:
    (a) Ensure the offender repays their debt to society through a structured sentence.
    (b) Provide for direct and indirect restitution to victims.
    (c) Instill the virtues of discipline, personal responsibility, and diligence through mandatory labor and education.
    (d) Prepare the offender for a safe and productive return to society, thereby reducing future harm.

#### **Section 2: The Mandate for Restorative Labor and Skills Development**

(1) A sedentary existence is contrary to the principles of justice and rehabilitation. Every incarcerated person subject to this Article who is physically and mentally capable shall be required to engage in full-time, productive labor.

(2) The purpose of this labor is twofold: to be **restitutive** and **rehabilitative**.
    (a) **Restitutive:** The labor shall be organized to generate value. All net revenue generated from such labor shall be deposited directly into the **National Victim Restitution Fund**. No revenue from inmate labor shall be used to fund the general operational budget of any correctional facility. To ensure its perpetual solvency, the Legislature shall appropriate to this Fund, on the first day of each fiscal year, an amount equal to no less than **five percent (5%)** of the total annual budget of the National Corrections Bureau.
    (b) **Rehabilitative:** The labor shall be, wherever practicable, structured to impart marketable skills and a disciplined work ethic. This shall include apprenticeships in skilled trades and other vocational training programs designed to facilitate lawful employment upon release.

#### **Section 3: Mandatory Education and Character Formation**

(1) To address the root causes of criminal conduct, every incarcerated person shall be required to participate in programs of education and character formation.

(2) Every person who has not completed a secondary school education shall be required to do so.

(3) Every person shall undergo a mandatory assessment and, where necessary, shall be required to complete programs addressing:
    (a) Addiction and substance abuse.
    (b) Anger management and conflict resolution.
    (c) Financial literacy and personal responsibility.
    (d) The moral principles of the **National Covenant**, with a focus on understanding the harm caused by their actions and the virtues required for a just life.

#### **Section 4: The Principle of Earned Progression and the Privileges Credit Scale**

(1) To incentivize reform, the corrections system shall be structured as a tiered progression. Incarcerated persons shall begin at a baseline level of discipline and may earn privileges and improved living conditions through the accumulation of **Privileges Credits**.

(2) The **National Corrections Bureau** is hereby mandated to establish and maintain a public **"Privileges Credit Scale."** This scale shall define a clear and objective system wherein specific, positive actions and achievements by an incarcerated person are rewarded with a set number of credits.

(3) Credits shall be awarded for achievements including, but not limited to:
    (a) Consistent good conduct and adherence to institutional rules.
    (b) Diligent and high-quality performance in assigned labor.
    (c) Completion of educational milestones, such as a secondary school diploma or a vocational certificate.
    (d) Successful completion of mandatory character formation programs.

(4) These accumulated credits may be redeemed by the incarcerated person to gain access to a defined list of earned privileges, which may include expanded visitation, access to institutional amenities, and eligibility for more desirable work assignments.

(5) The Legislature shall, by ordinary statute, establish a system of **Earned Time Credits**, whereby an incarcerated person who maintains a high standing on the Privileges Credit Scale may also earn a reduction in their total sentence.

#### **Section 5: Institutional Order and Daily Convocation**

(1) The daily routine of every correctional facility shall be structured, disciplined, and purposeful.

(2) All incarcerated persons shall be required to attend a **Daily Convocation** at the start of each day. The purpose of this mandatory assembly is to instill order and discipline. During this assembly, a member of the **National Chaplaincy Corps** shall read a passage of Scripture and offer a prayer. Incarcerated persons are required to be present and to stand in respectful silence during this observance but shall not be compelled to participate in any religious act.

#### **Section 6: Earned Religious Observance**

(1) In accordance with the Principle of Earned Progression, the right to attend a weekly, congregational Sunday worship service is a significant privilege that may be earned by those who have demonstrated a consistent record of good conduct and diligent participation in their rehabilitation programs.

(2) Attendance at any such service shall be strictly voluntary for all who have earned the privilege, in keeping with the right to Freedom of Conscience.

#### **Section 7: Restoration of Civil Rights**

(1) A sentence of general incarceration shall result in the temporary suspension, not the permanent extinguishment, of a person's civil rights, including the right to vote.

(2) Upon the successful completion of the person's full sentence, including any period of post-release supervision, all civil and political rights shall be fully restored.

#### **Section 8: Post-Release Supervision**

(1) Release from a term of general incarceration shall not be an abrupt event. Every release shall be followed by a mandatory and structured period of **Post-Release Supervision** (parole).

(2) The purpose of this supervision is to ensure a gradual and accountable transition back into society, to protect the public, and to provide the released person with the support necessary to prevent recidivism.

#### **Section 9: Proportional Eligibility Thresholds for Privileges**

(1) To ensure that the path to earning privileges is proportional to the severity of the offense as determined at sentencing, access to certain categories of privileges shall be subject to a mandatory minimum period of incarceration.

(2) The **National Corrections Bureau** is mandated to establish, by regulation, a tiered system of privileges and the corresponding eligibility thresholds. This system shall adhere to the following constitutional minimums:
    (a) **Tier 1 Privileges (e.g., expanded institutional amenities, access to non-essential programs):** An inmate is not eligible to redeem Privileges Credits for these benefits until they have served the first **one-quarter (25%)** of their total sentence.
    (b) **Tier 2 Privileges (e.g., expanded family visitation and communication):** An inmate is not eligible to redeem Privileges Credits for these significant benefits until they have served the first **one-third (33%)** of their total sentence.
    (c) **Eligibility for Earned Time Credits:** An inmate is not eligible to begin accumulating **Earned Time Credits** that reduce their total sentence until they have served the first **one-half (50%)** of their total sentence.

(3) For the purposes of this section, an inmate must have maintained a record of good conduct during the threshold period to become eligible.

### ARTICLE V: CONDITIONS OF CONFINEMENT FOR CIVIL DEATH

---

#### **Section 1: Applicability and Retributive Purpose**

(1) The provisions of this Article apply exclusively to persons serving a sentence of **Civil Death**.

(2) The conditions of confinement herein are not designed for rehabilitation, but for the fulfillment of a just sentence of **Retributive Toil and Permanent Removal** from society. The daily life of the offender shall be a constant and tangible reminder of the absolute forfeiture of their rights.

#### **Section 2: The Mandate for Retributive Toil**

(1) An idle life is a dishonor to God and an injustice to the society wronged. Every person serving a sentence of Civil Death who is physically and mentally capable shall be required to engage in a lifetime of full-time, grueling, and productive labor for the direct benefit of the state.

(2) The nature of this labor shall be determined by the National Corrections Bureau and shall be prioritized for large-scale infrastructure, agricultural, or industrial projects.

(3) This labor is a core and inseparable component of the sentence itself, serving as a tangible and perpetual repayment of the offender's debt to the nation.

#### **Section 3: The Standard of Austerity**

(1) The living conditions for a person sentenced to Civil Death shall be safe, sanitary, disciplined, and spartan.

(2) All comforts, luxuries, and forms of entertainment media are prohibited. Privileges shall be minimal and limited to those necessary for institutional order and safety.

(3) To enforce the principle of **Civil Death**, all contact with the outside world is intentionally severed. Communication shall be restricted to that which is necessary for legal counsel, as provided for in **Article III, Section 6**. All other forms of visitation or personal correspondence are prohibited.

#### **Section 4: Institutional Order and Daily Convocation**

(1) The daily routine of the institution shall be one of absolute discipline and order.

(2) All incarcerated persons shall be required to attend a **Daily Convocation** at the start of each day. During this mandatory assembly, a member of the **National Chaplaincy Corps** shall read a passage of Scripture and offer a prayer. Incarcerated persons are required to be present and to stand in respectful silence during this observance but shall not be compelled to participate in any religious act.

#### **Section 5: Prohibition on Communal Worship**

(1) A core component of the sentence of Civil Death is the offender's permanent removal from all forms of community, including the community of faith. Therefore, the right to attend congregational worship services is forfeit.

(2) This prohibition does not abridge the offender's universal right to possess a personal copy of the Holy Bible or to receive individual, confidential spiritual counsel from the **National Chaplaincy Corps**, as established in **Article II** of this Act. The path to repentance for such an offender is a solitary one.

#### **Section 6: Subordination to Universal Principles**

(1) The harsh and just conditions mandated by this Article are, at all times and without exception, subordinate to the universal principles established in this Act.

(2) The state shall administer this sentence as a minister of justice, not as a tormentor. The prohibitions against torture, cruelty, and willful neglect established in the **Imago Dei Firewall** and the right to conscience and Scripture are absolute and shall be strictly enforced.

---

### ARTICLE VI: ADMINISTRATION AND OVERSIGHT

---

#### **Section 1: The National Corrections Bureau**

(1) There is hereby established the **National Corrections Bureau** (NCB), an agency of the national government responsible for the administration and oversight of the corrections system.

(2) The NCB shall be headed by a **National Corrections Commissioner**, who shall be nominated by the Prime Minister and confirmed by a **two-thirds supermajority vote** of the Senate for a single, non-renewable term of ten years.

#### **Section 2: Mandate and Responsibilities**

The mandate of the National Corrections Bureau shall be to:
(a) Directly administer and operate all federal facilities designated for housing persons serving a sentence of **Civil Death**.

(c) Oversee the establishment and professional standards of the **National Chaplaincy Corps**.
(d) Develop and maintain the curricula for the mandatory educational and character formation programs prescribed in this Act.
(e) Manage the **National Victim Restitution Fund** and ensure its proper disbursement.

#### **Section 3: Federal and Provincial Jurisdiction**

(1) The National Corrections Bureau shall have exclusive jurisdiction over the confinement of persons sentenced to **Civil Death**.

(2) The provinces shall be responsible for the administration of correctional facilities for persons serving general sentences, in strict accordance with the national standards established by the NCB under the authority of this Act.

(3) A province's continued compliance with the standards of this Framework Act shall be a condition of its eligibility for federal funding related to justice and public safety, as shall be provided for by ordinary statute.

#### **Section 4: Mandatory and Independent Oversight**

(1) To ensure perpetual accountability and to guard against corruption, cruelty, and waste, the entire corrections system, both federal and provincial, shall be subject to the mandatory and independent oversight of the **Office of the Public Tribune**.

(2) The Public Tribune General is hereby granted automatic and permanent jurisdiction to:
    (a) Conduct full-scope financial audits of the National Corrections Bureau and any provincial correctional body to identify waste, fraud, and mismanagement.
    (b) Conduct unannounced, on-site inspections of any correctional facility in the nation to investigate compliance with this Act.
    (c) Investigate any and all credible allegations of a violation of the **Imago Dei Firewall** or the rights of incarcerated persons as established in this Act.

(4) The Public Tribune shall publish an annual public report on the state of the nation's corrections system, which shall include a detailed accounting of its findings and recommendations for reform. This report shall be presented to the Legislature and the nation.

#### **Section 5: Standard for Medical Exemption from Labor**

(1) An incarcerated person may only be deemed medically incapable of participating in mandatory labor upon the unanimous certification of a **Provincial Medical Review Board**, consisting of three independent physicians appointed by the Provincial Judicial Council.

(2) The sole standard for such a certification shall be a finding, based on objective and verifiable medical evidence, that participation in any available form of labor would pose a direct and substantial threat to the person's life or physical well-being.

(3) A finding of "mental incapacity" may only be made in cases of severe, debilitating psychosis or cognitive impairment and must be re-certified annually.

---

### ARTICLE VII: GENERAL PROVISIONS

---

#### **Section 1: Framework Act Status**

(1) This Act is a **Framework Act** as defined in **Article II of the Constitution of Government**. Its provisions are subordinate only to the **Charter of Immutable Principles** and the **Constitution of Government**.

#### **Section 2: Supremacy of This Act**

(1) In the event of a conflict between a provision of this Act and a provision of any other ordinary statute, including any provincial law governing corrections, the provisions of this Act shall prevail.

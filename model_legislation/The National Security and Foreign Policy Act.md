# The National Security and Foreign Policy Act

---

### PREAMBLE

WHEREAS the **Core Immutable Principles** establish Canada as a sovereign and independent nation;

AND WHEREAS the defense of the nation is entrusted to a well-regulated militia of its citizens, and not to a permanent standing army, requiring a foreign policy that forswears foreign intervention;

AND WHEREAS the conduct of foreign affairs and the maintenance of national security must be subject to the highest degree of constitutional discipline and public accountability;

NOW THEREFORE, this Legislature enacts the following framework to govern the nation's foreign policy, its intelligence operations, and its engagement with the world.

---

### ARTICLE I: GOVERNING PRINCIPLES OF FOREIGN POLICY

#### **Section 1: The Doctrine of Sovereign Defense**

1.  The permanent foreign policy of the nation shall be one of **Sovereign Defense**. The primary responsibility for the defense of the nation and its interests rests upon its own people through the **Regulated Militias**.

2.  The nation's default posture is one of non-intervention in the conflicts of other states. However, the nation may enter into formal alliances and cooperative agreements, provided they are in the direct national interest and conform strictly to the classifications and limitations established in this Act.

3.  A determination of "direct national interest" for the purpose of initiating treaty negotiations under this Act requires a **Joint Resolution of the Legislature**, passed by a two-thirds majority in both houses, which shall specifically name the proposed signatory nation and outline the precise strategic interests to be secured.

4.  The credibility of this doctrine is founded upon the nation's perpetual readiness and strategic self-reliance.

#### **Section 2: Classification of Alliances and Partnerships**

The government may only negotiate and ratify treaties that fall within one of the following two classifications:

1.  **Tier 1: Continental Defense Pact.**
    (a) **Eligibility:** This pact may only be entered into with a nation that shares a contiguous land border with Canada.
    (b) **Scope:** The pact shall be purely defensive in nature, activating only in response to a direct military attack on the **North American home territory** of a signatory by a non-signatory foreign power. It shall not obligate Canada to the defense of any overseas territory or interest of the signatory.
    (c) **Permitted Cooperation:** This pact may provide for a high degree of military cooperation, including:
        (i) The maintenance of joint air and maritime defense warning systems.
        (ii) The sharing of intelligence critical to continental security.
        (iii) The establishment of common operational doctrines and equipment standards.
        (iv) **The conduct of joint training exercises, which may include the temporary, reciprocal deployment of militia and military personnel to each other's territory for the sole purpose of such exercises.** Any such deployment of foreign personnel onto Canadian territory shall not exceed ninety (90) days in any calendar year. Any deployment exceeding this duration, or involving more than one thousand foreign personnel, shall require a specific authorizing statute passed by the Legislature.

2.  **Tier 2: Commonwealth Security Cooperation Agreement.**
    (a) **Eligibility:** These agreements may only be entered into with nations of the Commonwealth with which Canada shares a common Head of State, heritage, and fundamental commitment to the rule of law.
    (b) **Scope:** These agreements shall be for the purpose of cooperation and shall **not create a mutual defense obligation.**
    (c) **Permitted Cooperation:** These agreements may provide for:
        (i) The sharing of foreign signals intelligence.
        (ii) **Cooperation in securing common maritime approaches and trade routes**, including joint operations for search and rescue, disaster relief, and the suppression of piracy on the high seas.
        (iii) Exchanges of personnel for the purposes of training and professional development at each other's defense academies and facilities.
        (iv) The coordination of humanitarian and disaster relief operations.

#### **Section 3: The Principle of Sovereign Action (The Constitutional Firewall)**

1.  Notwithstanding any provision of any treaty, pact, or agreement ratified by the nation, the final authority to commit the **Regulated Militias** to armed conflict is a **sovereign and non-delegable power** that rests exclusively with the national Legislature.

2.  No treaty may contain any clause that creates an automatic declaration of war or an automatic commitment of forces. The activation of any defensive clause in any treaty is not self-executing. It may only authorize the government to bring the question before the Legislature.

3.  The deployment of any Canadian forces into an armed conflict, even a defensive one pursuant to a treaty, can only be authorized through the specific and exclusive procedures established in **Article III (The Declaration of War)** of this Act.

#### **Section 4: The Mandate for Strategic Self-Reliance**

1.  To ensure the long-term viability of its sovereignty, the government is hereby mandated to secure the nation's strategic self-reliance.

2.  This mandate requires, at minimum, the development and protection of a robust domestic capacity to produce the nation's essential needs, thereby preventing any foreign power from exerting coercive leverage through the control of critical resources.

3.  These strategic assets shall include, but are not limited to:
    (a) **The Defense Industrial Base:** All personal arms, munitions, and essential equipment required to maintain the **Regulated Militias** in a state of perpetual readiness, as mandated by the **National Militia Act**.
    (b) **Energy and Food Security:** The domestic production and reserves necessary to meet the nation's core energy and food requirements.
    (c) **Critical Medical Supplies:** The domestic manufacturing capacity for essential pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and emergency health supplies.
    (d) **Strategic Raw Materials:** The domestic extraction or, where necessary, the diversified sourcing and stockpiling of minerals and materials critical to the functioning of the defense and technology sectors.

4.  The Legislature shall, by statute, be authorized to designate certain industries and assets as "critical to national security." The government may prohibit the foreign ownership or control of any such designated asset.

---

### ARTICLE II: THE CONDUCT OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS

#### **Section 1: Executive Authority and Limitations**

1.  The Prime Minister and the government shall be responsible for the day-to-day conduct of the nation's foreign affairs. The Prime Minister, or their designated representative, shall be the nation's chief diplomat and negotiator.

2.  The executive power in foreign affairs is a delegated power, not an inherent one. All executive actions must be in strict conformity with the principles established in **Article I** of this Act and the laws of the nation.

3.  The executive branch is explicitly prohibited from unilaterally binding the nation under international law. The Prime Minister may negotiate and sign a treaty, but such a signature only signifies the government's assent to the text and shall have no legal force until the treaty is ratified by the Senate.

4.  **Executive Agreements:** The government may enter into minor, non-binding **Executive Agreements** with foreign states without requiring the full treaty ratification process.
    (a) The scope of such agreements is strictly limited to matters of administrative, technical, or scientific cooperation. This includes, but is not limited to, agreements concerning postal services, visa arrangements, aviation safety standards, or cultural exchanges.
    (b) An Executive Agreement is void if it purports to:
        (i) Commit public funds not already appropriated by the Legislature for that purpose.
        (ii) Commit the **Regulated Militias** to any form of action.
        (iii) Create a binding obligation under international law that would require a change in domestic law.
    (c) To ensure transparency, the full text of any Executive Agreement must be transmitted to the presiding officers of both houses of the Legislature and to the **Office of the Public Tribune** within ten days of its signing, and shall be made available in a public register.

5.  **Supremacy of the Ratification Process:** Any international commitment, understanding, or assurance made by any representative of the government that has not been subjected to the formal ratification process as defined in this Article, whether it is styled as a protocol, a memorandum of understanding, a side-letter, or any other name, is hereby declared to be **null, void, and without legal force or effect.** No public funds may be appropriated for its execution, and it may not be entered as evidence in any domestic court of law.

#### **Section 2: The Treaty Process: Negotiation and Constitutional Review**

1.  **Initiation:** The formal process to negotiate a treaty under **Article I, Section 2** of this Act may only be initiated after the Legislature has passed the required **Joint Resolution**. This resolution shall not be a general grant of authority, but shall establish a **"Statement of Negotiating Objectives and Red Lines,"** which shall be binding on the executive branch.

2.  **Amendments as New Treaties:** For the purposes of this Act, any proposed amendment, protocol, or annex that alters the substantive obligations, the geographic scope, or the list of signatories to an existing treaty shall be considered a new treaty and is subject to the full process defined herein, including the requirement for an initial **Joint Resolution**.

3.  **Negotiation:** Upon receiving this legislative mandate, the executive branch shall conduct the negotiations.

4.  **Constitutional Review:** Upon the conclusion of negotiations, and before the treaty is submitted to the Senate for ratification, the final text shall be transmitted to the **Council of Constitutional Guardians**.
    (a) The Council shall review the treaty for its conformity with the **Charter of Immutable Principles** and this Act.
    (b) The Council shall, within sixty days, produce a public **"Report on Treaty Compliance."** This report shall advise on whether the treaty, in the Council's opinion, presents any clear and direct conflict with the nation's foundational laws.
    (c) To ensure its independence, the Council of Constitutional Guardians shall be funded by a dedicated, non-lapsable **"Constitutional Review Trust Fund,"** established and funded by a formula identical to that of the **Public Tribune Trust Fund**. It shall have the authority to hire its own independent legal and expert counsel as required for its duties.
    (d) If the Council certifies, by a unanimous vote of its members, that the executive branch has failed to provide the necessary information to conduct a thorough review in a timely manner, the Council may petition the **full Supreme Court** for a single, non-renewable thirty-day extension to its review period.

5.  **Public Disclosure:** The Senate may not begin its formal debate or committee hearings on the ratification of a treaty until **thirty (30) days after** the **Council of Constitutional Guardians** has published its final "Report on Treaty Compliance."

#### **Section 3: Senate Ratification**

1.  Pursuant to the **Constitution of Government**, the exclusive power to give consent and formally ratify any international treaty is vested in the Senate.

2.  **Standard for Ratification:** For a treaty to be ratified, it must receive the affirmative vote of a **two-thirds supermajority** of the full membership of the Senate.

3.  **Elevated Standard for Ratification:** If the **Council of Constitutional Guardians**, in its "Report on Treaty Compliance," has identified a clear and direct conflict between the treaty and the **Charter of Immutable Principles**, the standard for ratification shall be elevated. The treaty may only be ratified upon an affirmative vote of a **three-quarters supermajority** of the full membership of the Senate.

4.  Upon successful ratification by the Senate, the treaty shall be presented to the Governor General for final ceremonial assent, at which point it becomes the binding law of the land, subject always to the supremacy of the **Charter of Immutable Principles**.

5.  **Form of Consent:** The Senate's consent to a treaty must be for the text of the treaty as it was negotiated and reviewed by the Council of Constitutional Guardians. The Senate's Resolution of Ratification shall not be valid if it contains any reservation, understanding, or declaration that purports to alter or limit the nation's obligations. If the Senate wishes to ratify the treaty subject to such conditions, it must pass a resolution directing the executive to re-negotiate the inclusion of those conditions as a formal amendment to the treaty text.

#### **Section 4: Treaty Withdrawal and Termination**

1.  The bonds of a ratified treaty are a solemn national commitment and shall not be broken by unilateral executive action.

2.  The executive branch may only deliver a formal notice of withdrawal, termination, or suspension of a ratified treaty after this action has been authorized by the Senate.

3.  Authorization to withdraw from a treaty requires a **"Resolution of Withdrawal"** passed by the **same supermajority vote** in the Senate that was required for its original ratification.

### ARTICLE III: THE DECLARATION OF WAR

#### **Section 1: Definition of a State of War**

1.  A **State of War** is a formal, legal state of armed conflict between the nation and a foreign power, authorized by the people in accordance with the procedures of this Article.

2.  A declaration of a State of War is the sole legal means by which the government may be authorized to conduct **sustained, offensive military operations** against an enemy power with the objective of defeating that power's armed forces and compelling its submission to the nation's will.

3.  This Article shall not be construed to abridge the authority of the **National Defense Council (NDC)** to authorize an **immediate, defensive military response** to a sudden attack as defined in the **Constitution of Government**. The NDC's authority is limited to repelling an immediate threat. The transition from defense to a sustained offensive campaign requires a formal declaration of a State of War.

4.  **Limitation on Emergency Powers:** The authority of the **National Defense Council (NDC)** to authorize defensive military action shall not be used as a substitute for a formal declaration of war. No military action authorized by the NDC against a single, named foreign power may be sustained for a cumulative total of more than **sixty (60) days** in any one-year period. Any continuation of armed conflict against that same power beyond this limit requires that the government cease hostilities or obtain a formal declaration of a State of War in accordance with the procedures of this Article.

#### **Section 2: Exclusive Grounds for Declaration**

A declaration of a State of War is a profound and final act of state and may only be lawfully considered under the following, and only the following, exhaustive circumstances:

1.  **Invasion of the Homeland:** In response to a sustained, armed invasion of the sovereign territory of Canada by the military forces of another nation.

2.  **Catastrophic Attack on the Militia:** In response to a direct and catastrophic attack on the **Regulated Militias of the Provinces**, whether at home or while operating lawfully in international waters or airspace, which results in a mass loss of life and degrades the nation's capacity for self-defense.

3.  **Activation of a Tier 1 Pact:** In response to a sustained, armed invasion of the **North American home territory** of a signatory to a **Tier 1: Continental Defense Pact**, as defined in this Act.

4.  **Absolute Prohibition:** No other circumstance, including but not limited to pre-emptive strikes, humanitarian intervention, the pursuit of economic interests, or conflicts involving the overseas territories of an ally, shall constitute lawful grounds for a declaration of a State of War.

#### **Section 3: The War Powers Procedure**

The authority to declare a State of War is a sovereign power of the people. It shall be exercised through the following, and only the following, mandatory and sequential procedure:

1.  **Step 1: Executive Petition.** The Prime Minister, upon a determination that one of the exclusive grounds in Section 2 has been met, shall formally petition the Legislature to declare a State of War. This petition must include a full report on the nature of the threat, **including all raw intelligence and evidence upon which the determination is based. This report shall be an unclassified public document.**

2.  **Step 2: The War Powers Resolution.** The Legislature shall debate the Prime Minister's petition **in an open and public session.** A State of War may only be authorized if both houses pass a **"War Powers Resolution."**
    (a) This resolution requires the affirmative vote of a **three-quarters supermajority** of the full membership of each house. The resolution must name the specific foreign power against which war is to be declared.
    (b) Before a final vote on the resolution may be held, the **Office of the Public Tribune** shall be granted a period of no less than seven days to conduct an **emergency audit** of the executive's evidence and shall publish a non-binding **"Report on the Casus Belli"** to the Legislature and the public, verifying the authenticity and context of the intelligence.
    (c) The War Powers Resolution must contain a clear and specific **"Statement of Military Objectives."** This statement must define a measurable end-state that constitutes victory. Any military operations that exceed the scope of this statement are unconstitutional and require a new, separate War Powers Resolution and subsequent public ratification.

3.  **Step 3: Ratification by National Referendum.** The power to declare war is not self-executing upon legislative approval. The War Powers Resolution passed by the Legislature is a contingent authorization that must be submitted to the people for final ratification in a national, binding referendum.
    (a) The referendum shall be held no later than **fourteen (14) days** after the passage of the War Powers Resolution.
    (b) The question on the ballot shall be: **"Do you authorize a State of War against [Name of Aggressor Nation] for the purpose of achieving the following objectives: [Text of the Statement of Military Objectives]?"**
    (c) The State of War is formally declared only upon the affirmative vote of a majority of the citizens voting in the referendum.

4.  **Emergency Protocol for Active Invasion:**
    (a) In the sole and extraordinary circumstance that the Legislature certifies, as part of its War Powers Resolution, that **"a state of active, large-scale invasion of the nation's home territory is in progress,"** the supermajority required for the resolution shall be elevated to a **four-fifths supermajority** of the full membership of each house. **This certification is valid only if the full Supreme Court, upon an emergency petition, confirms by a unanimous vote of all nine justices that the evidence irrefutably demonstrates the sustained presence of the formal, uniformed military forces of another sovereign power operating within the nation's continental territory with hostile intent.**
    (b) If this higher threshold is met, the State of War shall be deemed to commence **immediately** upon the passage of the resolution, allowing for immediate offensive operations to repel the invasion.
    (c) This immediate authorization is provisional. A national referendum must be held as required. If the people vote to reject the declaration of war, the State of War is immediately terminated. **For the purposes of this clause, only a certified majority vote of 'No' shall constitute a rejection.** An inconclusive, failed, or uncertified referendum shall not be deemed a rejection, and the provisional State of War shall continue in force until such time as a definitive 'No' vote can be certified or the two-year time limit on the declaration expires.

#### **Section 4: Duration and Re-Authorization of a State of War**

1.  A State of War, once declared, is not a perpetual grant of authority. The authorization granted by the people shall automatically expire **twenty-four (24) months** from the date of the referendum.
2.  If the military objectives have not been achieved and the government wishes to continue the State of War, it must, prior to the expiry date, seek a **"War Powers Re-Authorization Resolution"** from the Legislature.
3.  This Re-Authorization Resolution requires the same three-quarters supermajority in both houses and must be submitted to the people for ratification in a new national referendum. If it is not re-authorized, the State of War terminates on the two-year anniversary, and all forces must cease offensive operations.

### ARTICLE IV: NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND SECURITY

#### **Section 1: Establishment of the National Security and Intelligence Service (NSIS)**

1.  There is hereby established a single, civilian agency of government responsible for the nation's foreign intelligence and counter-intelligence activities, which shall be known as the **National Security and Intelligence Service (NSIS)**.

2.  The creation of any other agency, whether civilian or military, with a mandate for secret intelligence gathering is prohibited.

3.  The NSIS shall be an independent, non-partisan agency operating under the authority of the executive branch. The Director of the NSIS shall be nominated by the Prime Minister and must be confirmed by a **two-thirds supermajority vote** of the Senate for a single, non-renewable term of ten years.

#### **Section 2: Mandate: Foreign Intelligence and Counter-Intelligence**

1.  The sole and exclusive mandate of the NSIS is to defend the sovereignty and security of the nation from **foreign threats**.

2.  To fulfill this mandate, the NSIS is authorized to undertake the following activities:
    (a) **Foreign Intelligence:** The collection, analysis, and dissemination of intelligence regarding the capabilities, intentions, and activities of foreign powers and non-state actors outside the nation's borders.
    (b) **Counter-Intelligence:** The identification, investigation, and neutralization of foreign intelligence-gathering, espionage, sabotage, and covert action activities conducted by or on behalf of foreign powers **within** the nation's borders.

3.  The purpose of all intelligence activities is to provide the government with timely and objective information necessary to conduct foreign policy, protect against foreign aggression, and uphold the principles of this Act.

#### **Section 3: Absolute Prohibition on Domestic Powers**

1.  The NSIS is an instrument of foreign intelligence, not domestic law enforcement. It shall have no police powers.

2.  The NSIS is irrevocably prohibited from:
    (a) Conducting surveillance on, or maintaining any form of file or record on, a Canadian citizen, unless that citizen is first certified by the **Special Committee of the Supreme Court** as being an agent of a foreign power.
    (b) Undertaking any physical search, seizure of property, or interception of private communications within Canada, except under the authority of a warrant issued in accordance with the strict procedures defined in this Article.
    (c) Engaging in any activity for the purpose of suppressing domestic political dissent or monitoring the lawful activities of citizens.
    (d) Sharing intelligence with domestic law enforcement agencies for any purpose other than to alert them to an imminent threat of terrorist violence or to provide evidence of espionage by a foreign power. **Any evidence or investigative lead provided to domestic law enforcement by the NSIS shall be subject to the absolute exclusionary rule of Article 5 of the Charter of Immutable Principles. If a court finds that an investigation was initiated based on information obtained from the NSIS in violation of this Act, all evidence subsequently obtained in that investigation shall be deemed inadmissible.**

3.  All actions undertaken by the NSIS within the sovereign territory of Canada are subject to the **Charter of Immutable Principles**, including the warrant requirements of **Article 5**.

4.  **Definition of "Agent of a Foreign Power":** For the purposes of this Act, a Canadian citizen shall not be considered an "agent of a foreign power" unless the evidence demonstrates, to the standard of probable cause, that the citizen is **knowingly engaged in clandestine activities on behalf of a foreign power, subject to its direction or control, for a purpose that is prejudicial to the sovereignty or security of the nation.** The mere receipt of foreign funding by an organization or the expression of political opinions aligned with a foreign state shall not, in itself, be sufficient to meet this standard.

5.  **Prohibition on Outsourcing Surveillance:** It shall be unlawful for any employee or officer of the NSIS to request, direct, or solicit a foreign intelligence agency to conduct surveillance on a Canadian citizen, whether at home or abroad. Any intelligence on a Canadian citizen obtained from a foreign partner that the NSIS would be prohibited from collecting itself shall be inadmissible in any proceeding and may not be retained or disseminated.

#### **Section 4: Oversight and Accountability**

To ensure perpetual and robust oversight, the NSIS shall be accountable to a multi-layered, independent oversight structure.

1.  **Executive Oversight:** The Prime Minister shall provide high-level strategic direction to the NSIS.

2.  **Legislative Oversight:** There is hereby established a **Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence**, composed of the leaders of each recognized caucus in both the House of Commons and the Senate, and chaired by a member of the official opposition.
    (a) This committee shall have **absolute and unconditional** access to all intelligence assessments, operational reports, and financial records of the NSIS, **including those related to its most sensitive programs and covert actions.** No claim of operational security may be used to deny the committee access to information necessary for its oversight mandate.
    (b) The Director of the NSIS must report to this committee in a closed session no less than once every quarter.

3.  **Judicial Oversight and Warrants:** There is hereby established a **Special Committee of the Supreme Court**, composed of three justices of the Supreme Court, to serve as the judicial authority for the NSIS.
    (a) Any and all warrants for surveillance or search required by the NSIS for its counter-intelligence operations within Canada may only be issued by this Special Committee.
    (b) The standard for such a warrant shall be a showing of **probable cause** that the target is an agent of a foreign power engaged in clandestine activities against the nation.

4.  **Independent Audit:** The **Office of the Public Tribune** is granted automatic and mandatory jurisdiction to conduct a full financial and performance audit of the NSIS at any time to prevent waste, fraud, and mismanagement.

#### **Section 5: Whistleblower Protections**

1.  Any employee or officer of the NSIS who, in good faith, reports evidence of illegal activity, constitutional violations, or gross mismanagement to any of the oversight bodies established in Section 4 of this Article shall be protected by law from any form of retribution, dismissal, or prosecution.

2.  The act of making such a report through these official, legally protected channels shall not constitute an offense.

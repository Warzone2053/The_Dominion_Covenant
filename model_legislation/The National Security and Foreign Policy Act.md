# The National Security and Foreign Policy Act

---

### PREAMBLE

WHEREAS the **Core Immutable Principles** establish Canada as a sovereign and independent nation;

AND WHEREAS the defense of the nation is entrusted to a well-regulated militia of its citizens, and not to a permanent standing army, requiring a foreign policy that forswears foreign intervention;

AND WHEREAS the conduct of foreign affairs and the maintenance of national security must be subject to the highest degree of constitutional discipline and public accountability;

NOW THEREFORE, this Legislature enacts the following framework to govern the nation's foreign policy, its intelligence operations, and its engagement with the world.

### ARTICLE I: GOVERNING PRINCIPLES OF FOREIGN POLICY

#### **Section 1: The Doctrine of Sovereign Defense**

1.  The permanent foreign policy of the nation shall be one of **Sovereign Defense**. The primary responsibility for the defense of the nation and its interests rests upon its own people through the **Regulated Militias**.

2.  The nation's default posture is one of non-intervention in the conflicts of other states. However, the nation may enter into formal alliances and cooperative agreements, provided they are in the direct national interest and conform strictly to the classifications and limitations established in this Act.

3.  A determination of "direct national interest" for the purpose of initiating treaty negotiations under this Act requires a **Joint Resolution of the Legislature**, passed by a two-thirds majority in both houses, which shall specifically name the proposed signatory nation and outline the precise strategic interests to be secured.

4.  The credibility of this doctrine is founded upon the nation's perpetual readiness and strategic self-reliance.

#### **Section 2: Classification of Alliances and Partnerships**

The government may only negotiate and ratify treaties that fall within one of the following two classifications:

1.  **Tier 1: Continental Defense Pact.**
    (a) **Eligibility:** This pact may only be entered into with a nation that shares a contiguous land border with Canada.
    (b) **Scope:** The pact shall be purely defensive in nature, activating only in response to a direct military attack on the **North American home territory** of a signatory by a non-signatory foreign power. It shall not obligate Canada to the defense of any overseas territory or interest of the signatory.
    (c) **Permitted Cooperation:** This pact may provide for a high degree of military cooperation, including:
        (i) The maintenance of joint air and maritime defense warning systems.
        (ii) The sharing of intelligence critical to continental security.
        (iii) The establishment of common operational doctrines and equipment standards.
        (iv) **The conduct of joint training exercises, which may include the temporary, reciprocal deployment of militia and military personnel to each other's territory for the sole purpose of such exercises.** Any such deployment of foreign personnel onto Canadian territory shall not exceed ninety (90) days in any calendar year. Any deployment exceeding this duration, or involving more than one thousand foreign personnel, shall require a specific authorizing statute passed by the Legislature.

2.  **Tier 2: Commonwealth Security Cooperation Agreement.**
    (a) **Eligibility:** These agreements may only be entered into with nations of the Commonwealth with which Canada shares a common Head of State, heritage, and fundamental commitment to the rule of law.
    (b) **Scope:** These agreements shall be for the purpose of cooperation and shall **not create a mutual defense obligation.**
    (c) **Permitted Cooperation:** These agreements may provide for:
        (i) The sharing of foreign signals intelligence.
        (ii) **Cooperation in securing common maritime approaches and trade routes**, including joint operations for search and rescue, disaster relief, and the suppression of piracy on the high seas.
        (iii) Exchanges of personnel for the purposes of training and professional development at each other's defense academies and facilities.
        (iv) The coordination of humanitarian and disaster relief operations.

#### **Section 3: The Principle of Sovereign Action (The Constitutional Firewall)**

1.  Notwithstanding any provision of any treaty, pact, or agreement ratified by the nation, the final authority to commit the **Regulated Militias** to armed conflict is a **sovereign and non-delegable power** that rests exclusively with the national Legislature.

2.  No treaty may contain any clause that creates an automatic declaration of war or an automatic commitment of forces. The activation of any defensive clause in any treaty is not self-executing. It may only authorize the government to bring the question before the Legislature.

3.  The deployment of any Canadian forces into an armed conflict, even a defensive one pursuant to a treaty, can only be authorized through the specific and exclusive procedures established in **Article III (The Declaration of War)** of this Act.

#### **Section 4: The Mandate for Strategic Self-Reliance**

1.  To ensure the long-term viability of its sovereignty, the government is hereby mandated to secure the nation's strategic self-reliance.

2.  This mandate requires, at minimum, the development and protection of a robust domestic capacity to produce the nation's essential needs, thereby preventing any foreign power from exerting coercive leverage through the control of critical resources.

3.  These strategic assets shall include, but are not limited to:
    (a) **The Defense Industrial Base:** All personal arms, munitions, and essential equipment required to maintain the **Regulated Militias** in a state of perpetual readiness, as mandated by the **National Militia Act**.
    (b) **Energy and Food Security:** The domestic production and reserves necessary to meet the nation's core energy and food requirements.
    (c) **Critical Medical Supplies:** The domestic manufacturing capacity for essential pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and emergency health supplies.
    (d) **Strategic Raw Materials:** The domestic extraction or, where necessary, the diversified sourcing and stockpiling of minerals and materials critical to the functioning of the defense and technology sectors.

4.  The Legislature shall, by statute, be authorized to designate certain industries and assets as "critical to national security." The government may prohibit the foreign ownership or control of any such designated asset.

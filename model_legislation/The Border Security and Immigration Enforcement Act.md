### PREAMBLE

WHEREAS **Article 12 of the Core Immutable Principles** affirms that Canada is a sovereign and independent nation with the exclusive authority to govern its own territory and define the conditions of entry and residence;

AND WHEREAS the Rule of Law is a foundational pillar of the nation, requiring that all laws, including those governing immigration, be applied fairly, consistently, and without prejudice;

AND WHEREAS a just and orderly society must distinguish between the lawful immigrant, who is welcomed, and the illegal alien, whose presence is a violation of the national sovereignty;

AND WHEREAS the state, while possessing an absolute duty to enforce its laws and secure its borders, is also bound by the moral law to treat every person with the dignity inherent in their creation;

NOW THEREFORE, this Legislature enacts the following law to ensure the security of the nation's borders and the faithful enforcement of its immigration laws.

**(2) Purpose.** The purpose of this Act is to:
    (a) Establish the legal framework for securing the nation's borders against unlawful entry.
    (b) Define the legal status and consequences of being present in the nation in violation of its immigration laws.
    (c) Establish clear and effective penalties for those who facilitate, incentivize, or profit from illegal immigration.
    (d) Prohibit any subordinate jurisdiction from obstructing the enforcement of federal immigration law.

### ARTICLE II: ENFORCEMENT AT THE BORDER

**(1) Unlawful Entry.** It is unlawful for any alien to enter or attempt to enter the nation at any time or location other than a designated, lawful Port of Entry.

**(2) Expedited Removal.** An alien apprehended while attempting to unlawfully enter the nation, or who has unlawfully entered and been apprehended within one hundred (100) miles of the border and within fourteen (14) days of entry, shall be subject to **Expedited Removal**. This is a summary process wherein the alien shall be returned to their country of origin or last transit without a formal removal hearing, after their identity has been established.

**(3) Asylum Claims.**
    (a) An alien may make a claim for asylum only at a lawful Port of Entry. An alien subject to Expedited Removal is ineligible for asylum.
    (b) The state shall grant asylum only to an individual who demonstrates a credible and well-founded fear of imminent persecution in their home country, based on their religious beliefs, ethnicity, or membership in a specific social group.
    (c) For greater clarity, asylum shall not be granted on the basis of economic hardship, generalized crime or civil unrest, or any other reason not constituting direct, personal persecution. The burden of proof rests entirely on the claimant.

### ARTICLE III: INTERIOR ENFORCEMENT

**(1) Unlawful Presence.** It is unlawful for any alien to remain in the nation beyond the expiration of their authorized period of admission or in any other manner that violates the terms of their visa or residency status.

**(2) Cooperation Between Jurisdictions.** Provincial and municipal law enforcement agencies have an affirmative duty to cooperate with federal immigration authorities in the enforcement of this Act. All federal, provincial, and municipal agencies shall share information related to the citizenship status of any individual who is lawfully arrested or detained for any criminal offense.

**(3) Removal Proceedings.** An illegal alien found within the interior of the nation shall be subject to formal removal proceedings before a court of law. If the court finds that the person is in the country unlawfully, it shall issue a **Removal Order**, and the person shall be detained and deported to their country of origin.

### ARTICLE IV: CRIMINAL OFFENSES

**(1) Unlawful Entry and Presence.** An alien who unlawfully enters or remains in the nation is guilty of a misdemeanor offense, the primary penalty for which is removal from the country.

**(2) Unlawful Employment.**
    (a) It is a serious offense for any person or entity to knowingly hire, recruit, or continue to employ an illegal alien.
    (b) The Legislature shall, by statute, establish a mandatory and universal **National Employment Verification System.** All employers are required to use this system to verify the legal work authorization of all new hires.
    (c) Penalties for violating this section shall be severe and shall include escalating fines and, for repeat offenders, the potential for forfeiture of business licenses.

**(3) Human Smuggling and Trafficking.** Any person who knowingly smuggles, transports, or harbors an illegal alien for financial gain is guilty of a serious felony. If this offense is committed in a manner that endangers the life of the alien, or is in connection with any other serious crime, it shall be subject to the most severe penalties, up to and including imprisonment for life.

### ARTICLE V: PROHIBITION ON SANCTUARY JURISDICTIONS

**(1) Federal Supremacy.** The enforcement of immigration law is a matter of exclusive federal jurisdiction.
 
**(2) Absolute Prohibition.** All provincial and municipal governments are irrevocably prohibited from enacting or maintaining any law, policy, or practice that constitutes them as a **Sanctuary Jurisdiction**. This includes, but is not limited to, any measure that:
    (a) Prohibits their officials from asking about the citizenship or immigration status of an individual lawfully detained.
    (b) Prohibits the sharing of such information with federal authorities.
    (c) Grants illegal aliens access to non-emergency public benefits or official identification.

**(3) Enforcement.** Any jurisdiction found by the Supreme Court to be in violation of this Article shall be rendered immediately ineligible to receive any non-essential federal funds until such time as the sanctuary policy is repealed and the jurisdiction is certified to be in full compliance with federal law.

### ARTICLE VI: HUMANE TREATMENT

**(1) Upholding Human Dignity.** All actions taken to enforce this Act shall be conducted in a manner consistent with the **Imago Dei Firewall** as established in the nation's foundational laws. All aliens, whether legal or illegal, shall be treated with the human dignity inherent in their creation.

**(2) Conditions of Detention.** Any alien detained under the authority of this Act shall be:
    (a) Held in a secure and sanitary facility, separate from the general criminal population.
    (b) Provided with sufficient food, water, and necessary medical care.
    (c) Protected from cruelty, abuse, and exploitation.

**(3) Protection of Children.** An unaccompanied child who is an illegal alien shall be provided with safe shelter. The state's primary and urgent duty shall be to return the child to the care of their parents or legal guardians in their country of origin as swiftly and safely as possible. The child shall not be resettled within the nation.

---

### ARTICLE VII: GENERAL PROVISIONS

**(1) Supremacy of this Act.** In the event of a conflict between a provision of this Act and a provision of any provincial or municipal law, the provisions of this Act shall prevail.

**(2) Severability.** If any article, section, or provision of this Act is declared by the Supreme Court of Canada to be unconstitutional or otherwise invalid, such a finding shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of this Act.

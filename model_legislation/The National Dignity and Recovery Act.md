# The National Dignity and Recovery Act

---

### PREAMBLE

WHEREAS the **National Covenant** establishes that a just community is called to defend the cause of the weak and treat the vulnerable with dignity and compassion;

AND WHEREAS the state possesses a profound duty of care, as an expression of the nation's collective responsibility, to intervene for the protection of citizens who are unable to protect themselves from grievous harm;

AND WHEREAS such intervention must be therapeutic, not punitive, and must be governed by a framework that respects the rights and dignity of the individual while providing a structured pathway to recovery and stability;

AND WHEREAS this Act is intended to establish the permanent and binding operational rules for all such civil interventions, and is therefore a **Framework Act** as defined in **Article II of the Constitution of Government**;

NOW THEREFORE, this Legislature enacts the following law to provide for the support and recovery of the nation's most vulnerable persons.

---

### PART I: FOUNDATIONAL PRINCIPIPLES

**Section 1: Short Title**

(1) This Act may be cited as **The National Dignity and Recovery Act**.

**Section 2: Purpose and Scope**

(1) The sole purpose of this Act is to establish a civil, therapeutic framework to provide for the care, recovery, and protection of vulnerable persons who are found to be in a state of imminent peril to themselves.

(2) A proceeding under this Act is not a criminal proceeding. No order issued under this Act shall constitute a criminal sentence, and no criminal record shall result from any action taken herein.

### PART II: THE GRADUATED INTERVENTION FRAMEWORK

**Section 3: Initial Intervention (Tier 1)**

(1) On a person's first intervention proceeding under this Act, the judge shall issue a **"Support and Recovery Order."** This civil order shall, at minimum, require the individual to:
    (a) meet with a designated victims' advocate or social worker to be fully informed of available resources;
    (b) attend a state-funded initial assessment with a qualified counsellor or therapist; and
    (c) be granted priority access to any relevant public support services, including but not limited to safe housing, addiction treatment, and vocational training.

**Section 4: Second Intervention (Tier 2)**

(1) On a person's second intervention proceeding under this Act within a five-year period, the judge shall issue an **"Enhanced Support Order,"** which shall include a mandatory and structured program of case management and counselling lasting for a period of no less than six months.

**Section 5: Intensive Intervention (Tier 3)**

(1) On a person's third or subsequent intervention proceeding under this Act within a five-year period, the judge may, upon finding that it is necessary for the individual's personal safety and well-being, issue a **"Protective Residence Order."**
    (a) This civil order shall require the individual to reside for a period not to exceed ninety (90) days in a designated protective care facility operated by a Certified Partner Organization.
    (b) The purpose of this residence is to provide intensive therapeutic, medical, and vocational support, and to serve as a "circuit breaker" from a cycle of self-harm.

(2) **Mandatory Progress Review.**
    (a) No later than fourteen (14) days before the expiry of a Protective Residence Order, the court shall convene a **Progress Review Hearing.**
    (b) For this hearing, the Certified Partner Organization shall submit a formal "Progress and Recommendation Report" to the court, detailing the individual's engagement with the program and making a professional recommendation for their transition to post-release supervision.
    (c) At the hearing, after considering the report and hearing from the individual and their counsel, the judge shall make one of the following determinations:
        > **(i) Confirm Release:** If satisfied that the individual has made sufficient progress, the judge shall confirm the release and the commencement of the Post-Release Supervision period as defined in Section 6.
        > **(ii) Modify Supervision:** If the judge finds that the standard post-release plan is insufficient, the court may add specific, reasonable conditions to the first phase of Post-Release Supervision to ensure a stable transition.
        > **(iii) Grant a Limited Extension:** If, on the basis of clear and convincing evidence, the judge finds that the individual's premature release would pose an imminent and substantial danger to their own life, the judge may grant a single, non-renewable extension of the Protective Residence Order for a period not to exceed thirty (30) days, for the sole purpose of crisis stabilization.

### PART III: POST-INTERVENTION SUPPORT

**Section 6: Post-Release Supervision and Continuing Support**

(1) Every **Protective Residence Order** issued under Section 5 that results in a confirmed release shall include a subsequent, mandatory period of twelve (12) months of **Post-Release Supervision**, which shall consist of two distinct phases:
    (a) **Phase One: Intensive Reintegration (Days 1-30).** During the first thirty days following release, the individual shall work closely with their designated case manager to establish a stable living situation. This shall include, at minimum, weekly in-person meetings and active assistance in securing housing, employment, and access to community support networks.
    (b) **Phase Two: Sustained Support (Months 2-12).** For the subsequent eleven months, the individual shall be required to attend monthly check-ins with their designated case manager to monitor the individual's well-being and provide ongoing support.

(2) **Continuing Support Entitlement.** Upon the successful completion of the full period of Post-Release Supervision, the individual shall be granted the right to voluntarily access continuing support services for a period of ten (10) years.
    (a) This entitlement includes the right to contact their former case manager, or the office providing that service, to schedule appointments for guidance, crisis intervention, or referral to other specialized services as needed.
    (b) Access to these services is entirely voluntary. No adverse inference or penalty shall be attached to a person's decision not to utilize this entitlement.

### PART IV: INITIATION OF PROCEEDINGS

**Section 7: Triggers for an Intervention Proceeding**

(1) A court may only convene an intervention proceeding under this Act upon an application triggered by one of the following, and only the following, circumstances:
    (a) **Referral from the Justice System:** A formal referral from the Crown, pursuant to **Section 40 of the Foundations of the Criminal Law Act**, for a person identified as having provided a sexual service.
    (b) **Medical Peril from Severe Addiction:** A formal application by a designated public health officer, supported by a certificate from an attending physician, confirming that the individual has survived a life-threatening drug overdose and that, in the physician's opinion, the individual suffers from a chronic and severe addiction that poses an ongoing threat to their life.
    (c) **Imminent Danger from Mental Health Crisis:** A formal application by an immediate family member or a peace officer, supported by a certificate from at least one qualified physician or psychologist who has personally examined the individual, affirming that due to a severe mental health condition, the individual poses an imminent danger of serious physical harm to themselves.

(2) **Definition of Imminent Danger.** For the purposes of an application under subsection (1)(c), a state of "imminent danger of serious physical harm" may not be found unless supported by evidence of recent conduct, including but not limited to:
    (a) one or more credible attempts at suicide or serious self-harm;
    (b) the expression of specific threats of self-harm coupled with a feasible plan; or
    (c) a pattern of behaviour demonstrating a total inability to provide for one's own basic medical, nutritional, or shelter needs that is likely to result in death or grievous bodily harm.

### PART V: CERTIFIED PARTNER ORGANIZATIONS

**Section 8: Role of Charitable Organizations**

(1) The state shall fulfill its duty of care under this Act primarily through partnerships with non-governmental **Certified Partner Organizations (CPOs)**, in accordance with **Article 8 of the Core Immutable Principles**.
(2) CPOs shall be responsible for operating the therapeutic residences, providing case managers, and delivering the counselling and support services mandated by this Act.
(3) **Protection of Conscience.** All services provided by a Certified Partner Organization under this Act must respect the freedom of conscience of the individual. While a CPO may offer voluntary religious or spiritual programming, no person shall be compelled to participate in any religious study or observance as a condition of their residence, care, or privileges.

**Section 9: Certification and Funding**

(1) Each provincial government shall establish a fair and transparent process for certifying Qualified Charitable Organizations as CPOs. The standards for certification shall ensure a high quality of care, professional competence, and financial integrity.
(2) The provincial government shall provide funding to CPOs for the provision of services under this Act on a per-capita or other equitable basis.

**Section 9A: Provincial Compliance and Federal Transfers**

(1) It is a binding duty of each provincial government to ensure a sufficient number of Certified Partner Organizations are certified and adequately funded to meet the needs of its residents under this Act.

(2) Should a province fail in this duty, the federal government may, after providing formal notice, link the province's compliance with this Framework Act to its eligibility for full funding under other federal-provincial fiscal transfer agreements, in accordance with statutes enacted for that purpose.

### PART VI: RIGHTS OF THE INDIVIDUAL AND COMPLIANCE

**Section 10: Procedural Rights in Intervention Proceedings**

(1) Any person subject to a proceeding under this Act shall have the right:
    (a) to be given adequate notice of the proceeding and the grounds upon which it is based;
    (b) to be present, to be heard, and to present evidence;
    (c) to be represented by legal counsel, provided by the state if necessary; and
    (d) to appeal any order made under this Act to the provincial court of appeal.

(2) **Standard of Proof.** An order may be made under Section 3 or 4 of this Act upon a finding by the judge on a **balance of probabilities**. An order for a Protective Residence under Section 5 may only be made upon a finding based on **clear and convincing evidence**.

**Section 11: Compliance**

(1) Compliance with any Order issued under this Act, including all phases and conditions of Post-Release Supervision, is mandatory. A person who, without reasonable excuse, fails to comply is not guilty of a criminal offence, but may be subject to civil contempt proceedings or be rendered temporarily ineligible for certain non-essential government benefits until compliance is achieved. The Legislature shall enact a statute to define these benefits and procedures.

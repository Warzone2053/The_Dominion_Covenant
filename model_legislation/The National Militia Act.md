# The National Militia Act

---

### PREAMBLE

Pursuant to the mandate established in **Article V, Section 5 of the Constitution of Government**, this Act establishes the detailed organization, command structure, training, discipline, and rules of conduct for the **Regulated Militias of the Provinces**. Its purpose is to ensure the militias are a professional, integrated, and constitutionally-grounded force capable of fulfilling their duty as the sole guardians of the common defense.

---

### ARTICLE I: ORGANIZATION AND COMMAND

---

#### **Section 1: Federal Command for Materiel and Doctrine**

1.  There is hereby established the **Federal Command for Materiel and Doctrine**. This Command shall be the permanent federal body responsible for supporting the readiness of the Provincial Militias. Its duties are strictly limited to:
    (a) Overseeing all federal procurement and the equitable distribution of military materiel to the provinces, as directed by the **National Defense Council**.
    (b) Establishing and maintaining the curriculum for the **National Defense Academies** and all national standards for military training.
    (c) Developing robust and adaptive military doctrine for both conventional and asymmetric defense, preparing the militia to counter threats ranging from foreign invasion to domestic insurgency and information warfare.
    (d) This Command shall possess no authority to independently deploy troops or exercise operational command over any Provincial Militia.

#### **Section 2: Provincial Command Structure**

1.  Each province shall maintain its own militia headquarters, commanded by a senior officer, herein titled the **Adjutant General**.
2.  The appointment of a province's **Adjutant General** must be confirmed by a **two-thirds supermajority vote** of the provincial legislature to ensure broad, non-partisan support.

#### **Section 3: Inter-Provincial Mutual Aid Compacts**

1.  Provincial legislatures are hereby authorized to enter into **Mutual Defense and Aid Compacts** with one another.
2.  These compacts may establish unified command structures for the purpose of responding to regional natural disasters or other large-scale civil emergencies that affect multiple provinces, and may pre-authorize the movement of militia personnel across each other's borders for such purposes.
3.  No compact may supersede the authority of the federal government during a constitutionally declared State of Emergency.

---

### ARTICLE II: PERSONNEL AND TRAINING

---

#### **Section 1: National Defense Academies**

1.  The **Federal Command for Materiel and Doctrine** shall establish, fund, and operate a system of **National Defense Academies**, including a central senior military college.
2.  These academies shall serve as the primary source of commissioned officers for all Provincial Militias.
3.  Admission shall be by merit, based on a national standard. Admission slots shall be allocated to each province on a proportional basis according to population.
4.  Upon graduation and commissioning, an officer is obligated to serve their initial term in their **home Provincial Militia**. This ensures that national training serves to strengthen provincial command and prevents the formation of a separate federal officer class.

#### **Section 2: Joint Training Exercises**

1.  The **National Defense Council** is authorized to coordinate and fund large-scale, inter-provincial joint training exercises to ensure the ten Provincial Militias can function as a single, cohesive national force in a time of war.
2.  While participation in any specific exercise is voluntary, the provincial governments have a constitutional duty to ensure their militias meet the national readiness standards established by these exercises.

#### **Section 3: Standard of Good Standing**

1.  To remain a member in "good standing" of any Provincial Militia, a citizen must meet uniform national standards.
2.  These standards shall include, at minimum:
    (a) Adherence to prescribed physical and mental fitness requirements.
    (b) Absence of a criminal record for any felony or other serious offense as defined by federal law.
3.  Provincial commanders are responsible for the enforcement of this standard and are authorized to dismiss any member who fails to meet it.

---

### ARTICLE III: ENLISTED RECRUITMENT AND TRAINING

---

#### **Section 1: The National Standard for Enlistment**

1.  To ensure a uniformly high quality of personnel across all Provincial Militias, the **Federal Command for Materiel and Doctrine** is hereby mandated to establish and publish the **National Standard for Enlistment**. This standard shall be applied to all applicants without exception.
2.  The Standard shall consist of three components:
    (a) **Medical Fitness:** A candidate must pass a comprehensive medical examination designed to identify any physical or psychological condition that would predictably prevent them from performing their duties in a demanding operational environment or would pose an undue risk to themselves or their unit. The list of disqualifying conditions shall be made public and applied uniformly.
    (b) **Physical Fitness:** A candidate must pass the standardized **Enlistment Physical Fitness Test (EPFT)**. The EPFT shall be designed to measure the raw physical attributes necessary to succeed in military training. The test shall be identical for all applicants, regardless of sex or intended military occupation, and the minimum passing score shall be universal.
    (c) **Moral Character:** A candidate must meet the criteria for good standing as defined in **Article II, Section 3(2)(b)** of this Act, including the absence of a disqualifying criminal record.

#### **Section 2: Initial Entry Training (IET)**

1.  Each province shall be responsible for conducting Initial Entry Training for its recruits, in accordance with the national curriculum developed and maintained by the **Federal Command for Materiel and Doctrine**.
2.  IET shall consist of two distinct phases:
    (a) **Phase I: Basic Combat Training (BCT).** This universal phase shall be the process by which a civilian recruit is transformed into a disciplined, baseline soldier. The curriculum shall include, at minimum, proficiency in small arms, land navigation, field craft, first aid, the **Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ)**, and the physical and mental rigors of military life.
    (b) **Phase II: Advanced Individual Training (AIT).** Following successful completion of BCT, each recruit shall attend training for their specific military occupational specialty, ensuring they possess the technical skills required for their role within the militia.
3.  Successful graduation from both phases of IET is a prerequisite for being formally sworn into a Provincial Militia as a member in good standing.

#### **Section 3: The Graduated Physical Readiness Program**

1.  To ensure all members achieve the high level of physical readiness required for the common defense, IET shall employ a **Graduated Physical Readiness Program**.
2.  This program shall ensure that physical standards become progressively more demanding throughout the training pipeline. The minimum passing score on the **EPFT** is required for entry into training. The final graduation requirement for IET shall be a passing score on the **Militia Physical Fitness Test (MPFT)**.
3.  The **MPFT** represents the official, operational standard of fitness that every member of the Provincial Militias, regardless of rank or role, must pass at least annually to remain a member in "good standing." This aligns with the doctrine of universal combat readiness, ensuring every member is a soldier first.

### ARTICLE IV: JUSTICE AND CONDUCT

---

#### **Section 1: Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ)**

1.  A single, national **Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ)** shall govern the conduct of all militia members when on active duty, during paid training, or when otherwise acting under official orders.
2.  The UCMJ shall define offenses, trial procedures, and punishments. It shall be administered by a professional corps of military lawyers and judges.
3.  The UCMJ ensures a consistent standard of discipline and justice across all ten Provincial Militias.

#### **Section 2: Prohibition on Partisan Activity**

1.  The Regulated Militias shall be politically neutral. All members are prohibited from engaging in any partisan political activity while in uniform or on duty.
2.  It is illegal for any government or official to use militia personnel, equipment, or funds for partisan purposes, including but not limited to intimidating political opponents, securing polling places, or appearing at partisan rallies.
3.  The **Public Tribune General** is granted specific jurisdiction to investigate any allegation of the politicization of a provincial militia and may recommend the removal of offending officers or the prosecution of responsible officials.

---

### ARTICLE V: MOBILIZATION AND AID TO CIVIL AUTHORITY

---

#### **Section 1: Protocol for Emergency Military Aid to Civil Authority**

1.  In an extraordinary internal security crisis that poses an imminent threat of mass casualties and demonstrably exceeds the capacity of provincial and national police forces, a provincial government may formally petition the **National Defense Council** for military assistance.
2.  The **NDC** may, by a **unanimous vote** of its members, authorize the deployment of a specific **Ready Reaction Unit (RRU)** to provide limited, specialized support to the civil authorities.
3.  The military's role in such an operation is strictly limited to support functions, such as providing a secure outer perimeter, explosive ordnance disposal, or transport.
4.  **Absolute Prohibition:** RRU personnel are expressly prohibited from conducting arrests, searches, seizures, or other direct law enforcement actions against citizens.
5.  Any authorization granted under this section is for a non-renewable period of **72 hours**. The details of the authorization and the subsequent operation must be immediately transmitted to the **Public Tribune General** and the **Supreme Court** for real-time oversight.

---

### ARTICLE VI: NATIONAL SERVICE

---

#### **Section 1: Conscientious Objectors**

1.  A citizen may petition a provincial judicial panel to be legally recognized as a **Conscientious Objector**.
2.  To be granted this status, the petitioner must demonstrate, by a clear and convincing standard of evidence, a sincere and deeply held religious conviction that prohibits them from participating in any military activity, including non-combatant roles.

#### **Section 2: The National Service Corps**

1.  There is hereby established a civilian **National Service Corps**.
2.  Any citizen who is formally recognized as a **Conscientious Objector** shall be required to complete a term of service in the **National Service Corps**.
3.  The mission of the Corps shall be to undertake projects of national significance, including but not limited to disaster relief, infrastructure development, and wilderness conservation.
4.  This ensures that every citizen contributes to the well-being and security of the nation in a manner consistent with their conscience.

### ARTICLE VII: COMPENSATION, BENEFITS, AND CIVILIAN STATUS

---

#### **Section 1: Compensation and Pay Structure**

1.  To ensure fair and uniform compensation, the **Federal Command for Materiel and Doctrine** shall establish and maintain the **National Militia Pay Scale**.

    (a) Members of the Militia Reserve shall be compensated for each "Paid Training Day," which includes any day of authorized drills, exercises, or formal military education.
    (b) The base daily rate of pay for an entry-level member of the Militia Reserve shall be pegged to **one hundred and fifty percent (150%) of the national median individual daily income**, as calculated by the national statistics agency. This ensures that service is valued and that compensation keeps pace with the national economy.

    (a) Members serving full-time in a **Ready Reaction Unit (RRU)** shall receive a regular salary in accordance with the National Militia Pay Scale.

#### **Section 2: Benefits and Welfare**

1.  **Line-of-Duty Coverage:** All militia members, whether in the Reserve or the RRU, are covered by the state for any injury, illness, or disability incurred while performing their duties on official orders. The Legislature shall establish a comprehensive system for disability compensation and survivor benefits for those killed in the line of duty.

2.  **Health and Dental Care:**
    (a) **Militia Reserve:** Members of the Reserve are not entitled to a general public health plan by virtue of their service. Their coverage is limited to the Line-of-Duty provisions in Section 2(1).
    (b) **Ready Reaction Units:** Members of the RRU and their immediate families are entitled to enrollment in a comprehensive health and dental care plan provided by the state for the duration of their full-time service.

3.  **Retirement and Pension:**
    (a) **Militia Reserve:** To reward long-term part-time service, a **Militia Retirement Savings Plan** shall be established. For each Paid Training Day, the government shall contribute an amount equal to ten percent (10%) of the member's daily pay into their individual retirement account, which the member may not access until a defined retirement age.
    (b) **Ready Reaction Units:** A formal, tiered pension system shall be established for career members of the RRUs. The system, developed by the Federal Command, shall provide a defined pension benefit upon completion of a minimum of twenty years of continuous full-time service.

### ARTICLE VIII: ARMS AND EQUIPMENT

---

#### **Section 1: Federal Responsibility and Constitutional Compliance**

1.  The **Federal Command for Materiel and Doctrine** shall be responsible for the research, development, testing, and selection of all standard-issue arms and equipment for the Regulated Militias.
2.  All procurement and adoption decisions made by the Federal Command must be in strict compliance with the **Interoperability Mandate** as defined in **Article 9, Clause 8 of the Core Immutable Principles**.
3.  To ensure national self-reliance, all **Standard-Issue Personal Arms** adopted by the Federal Command must be manufactured within the sovereign territory of the nation.

#### **Section 2: The Militia Duty Rifle (MDR)**

1.  **Issuance upon Graduation:** Upon successful graduation from Initial Entry Training (IET), every member of the Regulated Militia shall be issued one new, complete **Militia Duty Rifle (MDR)** and its standard complement of magazines. This rifle, by serial number, is assigned to that individual member for the duration of their service.

2.  **Personal Custody and Responsibility:** The issued MDR is to be maintained in the personal custody of the militia member. The member is responsible for the rifle's proper maintenance, safekeeping, and security at all times. The MDR shall be presented for a formal inspection by a certified Provincial Militia armorer no less than once per year.

3.  **Vesting of Ownership upon Honorable Service:**
    (a) The MDR is held **in trust** by the member during their term of service.
    (b) Upon the **honorable completion of a full term of enlistment** (defined by law as no less than six years), legal and permanent ownership of that specific rifle shall be formally transferred to the individual member. It becomes their personal property, free and clear.
    (c) This ensures the MDR serves as both the tool of the soldier and the earned right of the veteran citizen.

4.  **Return of Property:** Any member who fails to complete their term of service for any reason (whether voluntary, for misconduct, or for medical reasons) has not vested their ownership. They shall be required to return the MDR to the Provincial Militia supply depot in good working order. Failure to do so shall constitute a serious offense under the **UCMJ**.

5.  **Prohibition on Transfer:** While the MDR is **held in trust**, it shall be unlawful for the member to sell, pledge, gift, or otherwise transfer the rifle.

#### **Section 3: Optional Use of Personal Arms**

1.  While the issued MDR is the standard, a member of the Regulated Militia retains the right to use their own lawfully acquired personal firearm in the course of their official duties, provided it meets the "functional equivalence" standard (same caliber, similar action, accepts standard magazines) as defined by the Federal Command.
2.  Any such personal firearm must pass the same safety and operational inspection required for the MDR before being authorized for duty use.

#### **Section 4: Crew-Served Weapons and Heavy Equipment**

1.  The principles of personal issuance and ownership apply only to the Militia Duty Rifle. Heavier, crew-served weapon systems (e.g., heavy machine guns, mortars, anti-tank guided missiles) and major platforms (e.g., armored vehicles, artillery) are not subject to these provisions.
2.  These advanced and heavy assets shall be held exclusively by the Regulated Militias of the Provinces and shall be stored in secure provincial armories. The distribution of these assets shall be equitable among the ten provinces.

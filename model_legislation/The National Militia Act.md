# The National Militia Act

---

### PREAMBLE

Pursuant to the mandate established in **Article V, Section 5 of the Constitution of Government**, this Act establishes the detailed organization, command structure, training, discipline, and rules of conduct for the **Regulated Militias of the Provinces**. Its purpose is to ensure the militias are a professional, integrated, and constitutionally-grounded force capable of fulfilling their duty as the sole guardians of the common defense.

### ARTICLE I: ORGANIZATION AND COMMAND

---

#### **Section 1: Federal Command for Materiel and Doctrine**

1.  There is hereby established the **Federal Command for Materiel and Doctrine**. This Command shall be the permanent federal body responsible for supporting the readiness of the Provincial Militias. Its duties are strictly limited to:
    (a) Overseeing all federal procurement and the equitable distribution of military materiel to the provinces, as directed by the **National Defense Council**.
    (b) Establishing and maintaining the curriculum for the **National Defense Academies** and all national standards for military training.
    (c) Developing robust and adaptive military doctrine for both conventional and asymmetric defense, preparing the militia to counter threats ranging from foreign invasion to domestic insurgency and information warfare.
    (d) This Command shall possess no authority to independently deploy troops or exercise operational command over any Provincial Militia.

#### **Section 2: Provincial Command Structure**

1.  Each province shall maintain its own militia headquarters, commanded by a senior officer, herein titled the **Adjutant General**.
2.  The appointment of a province's **Adjutant General** must be confirmed by a **two-thirds supermajority vote** of the provincial legislature to ensure broad, non-partisan support.

#### **Section 3: Inter-Provincial Mutual Aid Compacts**

1.  Provincial legislatures are hereby authorized to enter into **Mutual Defense and Aid Compacts** with one another.
2.  These compacts may establish unified command structures for the purpose of responding to regional natural disasters or other large-scale civil emergencies that affect multiple provinces, and may pre-authorize the movement of militia personnel across each other's borders for such purposes.
3.  No compact may supersede the authority of the federal government during a constitutionally declared State of Emergency.

### ARTICLE II: PERSONNEL AND TRAINING

---

#### **Section 1: National Defense Academies**

1.  The **Federal Command for Materiel and Doctrine** shall establish, fund, and operate a system of **National Defense Academies**, including a central senior military college.
2.  These academies shall serve as the primary source of commissioned officers for all Provincial Militias.
3.  Admission shall be by merit, based on a national standard. Admission slots shall be allocated to each province on a proportional basis according to population.
4.  Upon graduation and commissioning, an officer is obligated to serve their initial term in their **home Provincial Militia**. This ensures that national training serves to strengthen provincial command and prevents the formation of a separate federal officer class.

#### **Section 2: Joint Training Exercises**

1.  The **National Defense Council** is authorized to coordinate and fund large-scale, inter-provincial joint training exercises to ensure the ten Provincial Militias can function as a single, cohesive national force in a time of war.
2.  While participation in any specific exercise is voluntary, the provincial governments have a constitutional duty to ensure their militias meet the national readiness standards established by these exercises.

#### **Section 3: Standard of Good Standing**

1.  To remain a member in "good standing" of any Provincial Militia, a citizen must meet uniform national standards.
2.  These standards shall include, at minimum:
    (a) Adherence to prescribed physical and mental fitness requirements.
    (b) Absence of a criminal record for any felony or other serious offense as defined by federal law.
3.  Provincial commanders are responsible for the enforcement of this standard and are authorized to dismiss any member who fails to meet it.

### ARTICLE III: JUSTICE AND CONDUCT

---

#### **Section 1: Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ)**

1.  A single, national **Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ)** shall govern the conduct of all militia members when on active duty, during paid training, or when otherwise acting under official orders.
2.  The UCMJ shall define offenses, trial procedures, and punishments. It shall be administered by a professional corps of military lawyers and judges.
3.  The UCMJ ensures a consistent standard of discipline and justice across all ten Provincial Militias.

#### **Section 2: Prohibition on Partisan Activity**

1.  The Regulated Militias shall be politically neutral. All members are prohibited from engaging in any partisan political activity while in uniform or on duty.
2.  It is illegal for any government or official to use militia personnel, equipment, or funds for partisan purposes, including but not limited to intimidating political opponents, securing polling places, or appearing at partisan rallies.
3.  The **Public Tribune General** is granted specific jurisdiction to investigate any allegation of the politicization of a provincial militia and may recommend the removal of offending officers or the prosecution of responsible officials.

### ARTICLE IV: MOBILIZATION AND AID TO CIVIL AUTHORITY

---

#### **Section 1: Protocol for Emergency Military Aid to Civil Authority**

1.  In an extraordinary internal security crisis that poses an imminent threat of mass casualties and demonstrably exceeds the capacity of provincial and national police forces, a provincial government may formally petition the **National Defense Council** for military assistance.
2.  The **NDC** may, by a **unanimous vote** of its members, authorize the deployment of a specific **Ready Reaction Unit (RRU)** to provide limited, specialized support to the civil authorities.
3.  The military's role in such an operation is strictly limited to support functions, such as providing a secure outer perimeter, explosive ordnance disposal, or transport.
4.  **Absolute Prohibition:** RRU personnel are expressly prohibited from conducting arrests, searches, seizures, or other direct law enforcement actions against citizens.
5.  Any authorization granted under this section is for a non-renewable period of **72 hours**. The details of the authorization and the subsequent operation must be immediately transmitted to the **Public Tribune General** and the **Supreme Court** for real-time oversight.

### ARTICLE V: NATIONAL SERVICE

---

#### **Section 1: Conscientious Objectors**

1.  A citizen may petition a provincial judicial panel to be legally recognized as a **Conscientious Objector**.
2.  To be granted this status, the petitioner must demonstrate, by a clear and convincing standard of evidence, a sincere and deeply held religious conviction that prohibits them from participating in any military activity, including non-combatant roles.

#### **Section 2: The National Service Corps**

1.  There is hereby established a civilian **National Service Corps**.
2.  Any citizen who is formally recognized as a **Conscientious Objector** shall be required to complete a term of service in the **National Service Corps**.

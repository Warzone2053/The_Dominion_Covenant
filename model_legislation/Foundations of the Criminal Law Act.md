# Foundations of the Criminal Law Act

---

### PREAMBLE

WHEREAS the **National Covenant** establishes that the purpose of just government is to serve as God's instrument to restrain evil and to commend what is good;

AND WHEREAS the **Charter of Immutable Principles** establishes absolute limits on the power of the state and guarantees the rights of the accused;

NOW THEREFORE, this Legislature enacts the following foundational criminal law for the nation, to be interpreted in a manner consistent with the principles of Justice, Mercy, and the Sanctity of Life. **For greater clarity, this Preamble shall serve as a guide to the interpretation of this Act and shall not be construed to create any substantive right or defence in any criminal proceeding.**

---

### PART I: GENERAL PRINCIPLES

**Section 1: Basis of Criminal Responsibility**

(1) A person is not guilty of an offence unless their conduct is proscribed by law and their guilt is proven beyond a reasonable doubt in a fair and public trial.

(2) Every offence requires proof of two elements:
    (a) an *actus reus*, being a voluntary act, or **an omission where there exists a pre-existing legal duty to act. Such a duty may be established by statute, by contract, by virtue of a special relationship such as that between a parent and child, or by one's own actions in creating a situation of danger;** and
    (b) a *mens rea*, being a guilty mind or the intent to commit the prohibited act.

(3) A person shall not be held criminally responsible for an act committed under duress of a direct and imminent threat of death or grievous bodily harm **to themselves or another person**.

(4) A person who, by reason of a severe mental disorder, was incapable of appreciating the nature of their act or knowing that it was morally wrong, shall be found not criminally responsible. **The party raising this issue must prove it on a balance of probabilities.** The disposition of such a case shall prioritize the safety of the public and the provision of appropriate medical care under the supervision of an independent Board of Review.

**Section 1A: Justifiable Use of Force**

**(1) Defense of Person:** A person is justified in using force against another when and to the extent that they **reasonably believe** such force is necessary to defend themselves or another person against the other's imminent use of unlawful force.

**(2) Use of Lethal Force:** For greater clarity, and in accordance with **Article 1 of the Core Immutable Principles**, the use of lethal force is justified only when a person reasonably believes it is necessary to prevent **imminent death or grievous bodily harm** to themselves or another innocent person.
    (a) For the purposes of this section, **"lethal force"** means any force that is intended or known by the person using it to be capable of causing death or grievous bodily harm.
    (b) For the purposes of this section, **"grievous bodily harm"** means any injury that creates a substantial risk of death, or that causes serious and permanent disfigurement or protracted loss or impairment of the function of any bodily member or organ.
    (c) For the purposes of this section, an **"imminent"** threat is one that a person reasonably believes is immediate, pressing, and will occur without undue delay. It is a threat that is on the point of happening and not a threat of future or speculative harm.

**(3) No Duty to Retreat (The Castle Doctrine):** A person who is not engaged in unlawful activity and is in any place they have a lawful right to be has **no duty to retreat** and has the right to stand their ground and meet force with force, including lethal force if justified under subsection (2).
    (a) There shall be a **legal presumption** that a person had a reasonable fear of imminent death or grievous bodily harm if the person against whom the force was used was in the process of **unlawfully and forcibly entering**, or had unlawfully and forcibly entered, a person's occupied dwelling, vehicle, or place of business.
    (b) For the purposes of this subsection:
        (i) **"Dwelling"** includes an attached porch, deck, or patio, and in the case of an apartment or condominium, the presumption extends only to the interior of the individual unit.
        (ii) The presumption **does not apply** if the person against whom the force was used had an initial right to be in the dwelling (e.g., as an invitee or co-resident) and the encounter arises after that right was revoked. In such cases, the general right of self-defense under subsection (1) and (2) still applies, but without the benefit of the legal presumption.

**(4) Defense of Property:** A person in lawful possession of property is justified in using **reasonable, non-lethal force** to prevent or terminate what they reasonably believe is an unlawful trespass or an unlawful interference with that property.
    (a) The use of lethal force is not justified under this subsection for the sole purpose of defending property.
    (b) However, should a person unlawfully interfering with property respond with or threaten imminent unlawful force against a person, the right of self-defense under subsections (1) and (2) is triggered.

**(5) Limitation on Initial Aggressors:** The justification of force described in this section is not available to a person who:
    (a) initially provokes the use of force against themselves with the intent to use such force as an excuse to inflict harm on the other person; or
    (b) is the initial aggressor, unless they have, in good faith, withdrawn from the encounter and have clearly communicated their intent to do so, and the other person continues to use or threaten imminent unlawful force.

**(6) Interpretation of "Reasonable Belief":** For all purposes within this section, a "reasonable belief" is one that has two components:
    (a) The person genuinely held the belief in their own mind at the time (a subjective standard); and
    (b) The belief was one that a prudent and law-abiding person, possessing the same knowledge and situated in the same circumstances as the actor, would have held (an objective standard).

**(7) Unintended Consequences of Force:** If a person uses a degree of force that is justified under this section, but in doing so causes an unintended and unjustifiable harm (e.g., using non-lethal force that recklessly or negligently causes death), the justification provided by this section may serve as a defense against the primary intended offence, but it may not serve as a complete defense against a separate charge arising from the reckless or negligent result.

---

**Section 1B: Arrest by a Private Citizen**

**(1) Grounds for Arrest:** Any person may arrest another person without a warrant if they **find them committing**, or have reasonable grounds to believe they have just committed and are escaping from, an **indictable offence**.
    (a) For the purposes of this section, "committing" includes being in the act of **attempting** to commit an indictable offence.
    (b) An exception is made for property: A person may also arrest another whom they find committing any criminal offence on or in relation to their property.

**(2) Arrest of Fleeing Offender:** Any person may arrest another person without a warrant if they have **reasonable grounds to believe**:
    (a) that the other person has committed an indictable offence; and
    (b) that the other person is escaping from and being freshly pursued by persons who have lawful authority to arrest that person.

**(3) Use of Force in Arrest or to Stop an Offence in Progress:** A person is justified in using as much force as is **reasonably necessary** to:
    (a) effect a lawful arrest under this section; or
    (b) stop another person whom they find in the act of committing an indictable offence.

**(4) Prohibition on Lethal Force:** The use of lethal force is **not justified** under the authority of this section unless the force is otherwise justified under **Section 1A (Justifiable Use of Force)**. For greater clarity, a citizen may not use lethal force solely to effect an arrest or prevent the escape of a person for a property-related crime. Lethal force is only permissible if the person being arrested or stopped poses a threat of imminent death or grievous bodily harm to the citizen or another person.

**(5) Duty After Arrest or Intervention:** A person who makes an arrest or uses force to stop an offence under this section shall, **without unreasonable delay**, deliver any person they have detained to a peace officer to be dealt with according to law.

**(6) Legal Protection and Liability:**
    (a) A person who lawfully makes an arrest or uses justifiable force to stop an offence in accordance with this section shall be **justified and held harmless** from any criminal or civil liability for the act itself.
    (b) **Liability for Mistake:** If a person makes an arrest based on a mistake:
        (i) **Mistake of Identity:** They are justified and protected from liability if they had reasonable grounds to believe the person they arrested was the one who committed the offence.
        (ii) **Mistake of Offence:** They are **not protected** from liability if it is discovered that **no indictable offence was actually committed** or attempted by anyone in relation to the circumstances.

---

**Section 1C: Principles of Sentencing**

(1) The fundamental purpose of sentencing is to contribute to respect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful, and safe society by imposing just sanctions that have one or more of the following objectives:
    (a) to denounce unlawful conduct and the harm done to victims and the community;
    (b) to deter the offender and other persons from committing offences;
    (c) to separate offenders from society, where necessary;
    (d) to assist in rehabilitating offenders;
    (e) to provide reparations for harm done to victims or to the community; and
    (f) to promote a sense of responsibility in offenders, and an acknowledgment of the harm done.

(2) **Mandatory Consideration of the National Covenant.** In determining a just sanction, and in weighing the objectives listed above, a sentencing judge **shall give primary consideration to the virtues articulated in the National Covenant**. The judge must, in their written reasons for sentencing, explicitly state which virtues were considered and how they informed the final sentence.

(3) **Specific Application of Virtues.** Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the judge shall consider:
    (a) The virtues of **Justice** and **Personal Responsibility** when considering the gravity of the offence and the offender's moral culpability.
    (b) The virtue of **Mercy** when considering the personal circumstances of the offender and any mitigating factors.
    (c) The virtue of **Reconciliation** when considering restorative justice objectives and reparations to the victim and the community.

(4) A sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.

    (b) kidnaps a person under the age of eighteen years with the intent to sexually assault, inflict grievous bodily harm upon, or traffic them; or

### PART III: OFFENCES AGAINST THE PERSON

**Section 6: Homicide and "Human Being" Defined**

(1) A person commits homicide when, directly or indirectly, by any means, they cause the death of a human being.

(2) Homicide is either culpable or not culpable. Homicide that is not culpable is not an offence.

(3) Pursuant to **Article 1 of the Core Immutable Principles**, for all purposes of this Act, a **"human being" is defined as a living person from the moment of conception until natural death.** An act or omission that causes the death of a human being so defined constitutes a homicide **and is subject to the provisions of Section 7 regarding culpability.**

---

**Section 7: Culpable Homicide**

(1) Homicide is culpable when a person causes the death of a human being:

    (b) by criminal negligence; or
    (c) by causing that human being, by threats or fear of violence or by deception, to do anything that causes their own death.

(2) Culpable homicide is either murder or manslaughter.

(3) **Principle of Equal and Inviolable Value.** The law shall hold that the life of a mother and the life of her unborn child possess equal and inviolable value.

(4) **The Unified Duty to Intervene and Deliver.** When a verifiable medical condition creates a situation where the continuation of the pregnancy poses a direct mortal threat to the mother OR where it poses a mortal threat to the unborn child, the medical team has an absolute duty to deliver the child by the medically safest available method. This duty applies regardless of the child's gestational age or prospects for survival.

(5) **The Duty of Post-Natal Care.** Following a delivery mandated by this section, the child, as a living human being, shall be provided with all appropriate life-sustaining, medical, and palliative care until their natural death. The child shall not be abandoned, neglected, or denied care.

(6) **Attribution of Legal Cause of Death.** Where the duties in this section have been fulfilled in good faith, and the child subsequently dies due to its extreme prematurity or an underlying medical condition, the death shall not constitute a culpable homicide. For all legal purposes, the cause of death shall be attributed to the child's pathology or immaturity (i.e., natural causes), not to the act of delivery which was performed to resolve a mortal threat. This section provides a complete legal defense against any charge of homicide for the medical professionals involved.

---

**Section 8: Murder**

Culpable homicide is murder where the person who causes the death of a human being:
(a) means to cause their death; or
(b) means to cause them bodily harm that they know is likely to cause their death, and is reckless whether death ensues or not.

---

**Section 9: Classification of Murder**

(1) Murder is first-degree murder or second-degree murder.

(2) Murder is first-degree murder when it is planned and deliberate.

(3) Without limiting the generality of subsection (2), murder is also first-degree murder when the victim is a peace officer acting in the course of their duties, or when the death is caused by a person while committing or attempting to commit another serious offence, including:
    (a) treason;
    (b) kidnapping;
    (c) sexual assault or aggravated sexual assault; or

(2) For a person sentenced to life imprisonment for first-degree murder, the period of parole ineligibility shall be twenty-five years.

(3) For a person sentenced to life imprisonment for second-degree murder, the period of parole ineligibility shall be determined by the court and shall be no less than ten years and no more than twenty-five years.

(4) Every person who commits manslaughter is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for life.

    > (a) For the purposes of this subsection, **"wilful blindness"** is established only where the Crown proves beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused had firm suspicions that the additional offence was likely to occur, but deliberately chose to remain ignorant of that fact. Mere negligence or failure to inquire is insufficient to establish wilful blindness.

    >
    > (c) **Limitation on Liability (Family).** A person is **not** guilty of being an accessory after the fact by reason only that they provide life-sustaining aid to their spouse, their parent, or their child.

    > >
    > > (ii) This protection **does not extend** to any act intended to actively and permanently obstruct the course of justice, including but not limited to: providing funds for flight, destroying evidence, providing a false alibi, or arranging transportation for the purpose of escape.

---

**Section 18: Counselling an Offence**

(1) Every one who counsels another person to commit an offence is, if the offence is committed, a party to that offence, provided the counsellor had the **specific intent** that the offence be committed.

(2) A person who counsels an offence is also a party to any other offence that the person counselled commits in consequence of the counselling, but only if the counsellor **knew or intended** that the other offence was a likely consequence of carrying out the counselled offence.

    > (a) In making this determination, the court **shall consider the proximity of the accused's conduct to the completion of the target offence**, having regard to factors such as:
    > > (i) The acquisition and possession of materials specifically required to commit the offence;
    > > (ii) The physical presence of the accused at or near the contemplated scene of the crime;
    > > (iii) Overt acts of reconnaissance or surveillance of the intended victim or place; and
    > > (iv) The extent to which the accused's actions remain equivocal or can serve no other purpose than the commission of the intended offence.

(3) Every one who attempts to commit an offence is, unless a different punishment is prescribed, guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding half of the longest term to which a person who is guilty of that offence is liable.

---

### PART VI: SEXUAL OFFENCES

**Section 21: Sexual Assault**

(1) A **sexual assault** is an assault under Section 11 of this Act that is of a sexual nature.

(2) In determining whether an assault is of a sexual nature, the court shall consider all the circumstances from the perspective of an objective, reasonable person, including but not limited to:
    (a) the part of the body touched;
    (b) the nature of the contact;
    (c) the situation in which the contact occurred; and
    (d) any words or gestures accompanying the act.

(3) The accused's stated or perceived purpose is not determinative. An assault that is objectively sexual in nature does not cease to be so merely because it was committed for a purpose of humiliation, degradation, or the assertion of dominance.

(4) Every one who commits a sexual assault is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years.

---

**Section 22: Consent in Sexual Offences**

(1) For the purposes of this Part, **"consent"** means the voluntary agreement of the complainant to engage in the *specific* sexual activity in question. Consent must be both affirmative and continuous throughout the sexual activity.

(2) No consent is obtained, as a matter of law, where:
    (a) the agreement is expressed by the words or conduct of a person other than the complainant;
    (b) the complainant is **incapable of consenting** to the activity, as defined in this section;
    (c) the accused induces the complainant to engage in the activity by abusing a **position of trust, power, or authority**, as defined in this section;
    (d) the complainant expresses, by words or conduct, a lack of agreement to engage in the activity;
    (e) the complainant, having consented to engage in sexual activity, expresses, by words or conduct, a lack of agreement to *continue* to engage in the activity; or
    (f) the complainant is induced to engage in the act by **fraud as to the nature and quality of the act, or the identity of the accused.**

(3) The accused's belief that the complainant consented is not a defence if:
    (a) that belief arose from the accused’s self-induced intoxication;
    (b) the accused was reckless or wilfully blind as to whether the complainant was consenting; or
    (c) the accused did not take **reasonable steps** in the circumstances known to the accused at the time to ascertain that the complainant was consenting.

(4) Nothing in this section shall be construed to permit an accused to rely on a defence of implied consent. Consent must be affirmatively and consciously given for each instance of sexual activity. A complainant's past consent to sexual activity, with either the accused or any other person, does not imply consent to the activity in question.

(5) **Incapacity to Consent.**
    (a) A person is **incapable of consenting** if they are unconscious, asleep, or in a state of intoxication or other condition that renders them unable to consciously understand the nature, risks, and consequences of the sexual activity, or unable to communicate their consent or withdrawal thereof.
    (b) For greater clarity, the fact that a person has consumed alcohol or other intoxicants **does not, in itself, render them incapable of consenting**. The determination of incapacity shall be based on the evidence of the complainant's actual state of mind and physical control at the time of the act, not merely on the presence of intoxicants.

(6) **Position of Trust, Power, or Authority.** For the purpose of subsection (2)(c), this includes, but is not limited to, a relationship between the complainant and an accused who is their:
    (a) doctor, therapist, or other healthcare provider;
    (b) teacher or school official;
    (c) employer or supervisor;
    (d) peace officer, correctional officer, or judicial official; or
    (e) any other relationship of a similar nature where one person has a manifest and significant degree of authority or dependency over the other.

(1) Every one commits an offence who, in committing a sexual assault,
    (a) carries, uses, or threatens to use a **weapon**;
    (b) threatens to cause bodily harm to a person other than the complainant; or
    (c) causes **bodily harm** to the complainant.

---

**Section 24: Aggravated Sexual Assault**

(1) Every one commits an **aggravated sexual assault** who, in committing a sexual assault, wounds, maims, disfigures, or endangers the life of the complainant.

(2) Every one who commits an aggravated sexual assault is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for life.

(3) For greater clarity, where an aggravated sexual assault is committed against a person under the age of eighteen years, it shall constitute a "Heinous Crime Against a Child" and is subject to the mandatory sentencing provisions in **Section 4** of this Act.

---

**Section 25: Definition of Weapon**

(1) For the purposes of this Act, **"weapon"** means:
    (a) anything designed to be used in causing death or injury to any person; or

(2) For the purposes of this section, a **"Constitutional Officer"** is defined as:
    (a) a member of the House of Commons or the Senate;
    (b) a judge of any court;
    (c) the Public Tribune General or any person employed in their office with investigative authority; or
    (d) any member of a Grand Jury or a National Citizen Jury.

(3) For greater clarity, a **"benefit of any kind"** includes, but is not limited to, any financial advantage, promise of future employment, or any political or charitable donation made at the direction of, or for the advantage of, the officer or their family.

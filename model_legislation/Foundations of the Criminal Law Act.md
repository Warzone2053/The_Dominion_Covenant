# Foundations of the Criminal Law Act

---

### PREAMBLE

WHEREAS the **National Covenant** establishes that the purpose of just government is to serve as God's instrument to restrain evil and to commend what is good;

AND WHEREAS the **Charter of Immutable Principles** establishes absolute limits on the power of the state and guarantees the rights of the accused;

NOW THEREFORE, this Legislature enacts the following foundational criminal law for the nation, to be interpreted in a manner consistent with the principles of Justice, Mercy, and the Sanctity of Life. **For greater clarity, this Preamble shall serve as a guide to the interpretation of this Act and shall not be construed to create any substantive right or defence in any criminal proceeding.**

### PART I: GENERAL PRINCIPLES

**Section 1: Basis of Criminal Responsibility**

(1) A person is not guilty of an offence unless their conduct is proscribed by law and their guilt is proven beyond a reasonable doubt in a fair and public trial.

(2) Every offence requires proof of two elements:
    (a) an *actus reus*, being a voluntary act, or **an omission where there exists a pre-existing legal duty to act. Such a duty may be established by statute, by contract, by virtue of a special relationship such as that between a parent and child, or by one's own actions in creating a situation of danger;** and
    (b) a *mens rea*, being a guilty mind or the intent to commit the prohibited act.

(3) A person shall not be held criminally responsible for an act committed under duress of a direct and imminent threat of death or grievous bodily harm **to themselves or another person**.

(4) A person who, by reason of a severe mental disorder, was incapable of appreciating the nature of their act or knowing that it was morally wrong, shall be found not criminally responsible. **The party raising this issue must prove it on a balance of probabilities.** The disposition of such a case shall prioritize the safety of the public and the provision of appropriate medical care under the supervision of an independent Board of Review.

---

**Section 4: Heinous Crimes Against a Child**

(1) This section is enacted pursuant to the mandate of **Article 1, Section 5 of the Core Immutable Principles**.

(2) A person commits a "Heinous Crime Against a Child" who:
    (a) commits the first-degree murder of a person under the age of eighteen years;
    (b) kidnaps a person under the age of eighteen years with the intent to sexually assault, inflict grievous bodily harm upon, or traffic them; or
    (c) commits an aggravated sexual assault against a person under the age of eighteen years. **For the purposes of this section, a sexual assault is deemed "aggravated" if it is committed in a manner that wounds, maims, disfigures, or endangers the life of the complainant, is committed with a weapon, or is committed by more than one assailant acting in concert.**

(3) Notwithstanding any other provision of this or any other Act, any person convicted of an offence under this section **shall be sentenced to imprisonment for the full remainder of their natural life**. This sentence is absolute, and the person shall not be eligible for parole.

    (a) desecrates **a place that is set apart for and regularly used for public religious worship**, or its sacred objects; or

### PART III: OFFENCES AGAINST THE PERSON

**Section 6: Homicide and "Human Being" Defined**

(1) A person commits homicide when, directly or indirectly, by any means, they cause the death of a human being.

(2) Homicide is either culpable or not culpable. Homicide that is not culpable is not an offence.

(3) Pursuant to **Article 1 of the Core Immutable Principles**, for all purposes of this Act, a **"human being" is defined as a living person from the moment of conception until natural death.** An act or omission that causes the death of a human being so defined constitutes a homicide **and is subject to the provisions of Section 7 regarding culpability.**

---

**Section 7: Culpable Homicide**

(1) Homicide is culpable when a person causes the death of a human being:
    (a) by means of an unlawful act;
    (b) by criminal negligence; or
    (c) by causing that human being, by threats or fear of violence or by deception, to do anything that causes their own death.

(2) Culpable homicide is either murder or manslaughter.

(3) **Principle of Equal and Inviolable Value.** The law shall hold that the life of a mother and the life of her unborn child possess equal and inviolable value.

(4) **The Unified Duty to Intervene and Deliver.** When a verifiable medical condition creates a situation where the continuation of the pregnancy poses a direct mortal threat to the mother OR where it poses a mortal threat to the unborn child, the medical team has an absolute duty to deliver the child by the medically safest available method. This duty applies regardless of the child's gestational age or prospects for survival.

(5) **The Duty of Post-Natal Care.** Following a delivery mandated by this section, the child, as a living human being, shall be provided with all appropriate life-sustaining, medical, and palliative care until their natural death. The child shall not be abandoned, neglected, or denied care.

(6) **Attribution of Legal Cause of Death.** Where the duties in this section have been fulfilled in good faith, and the child subsequently dies due to its extreme prematurity or an underlying medical condition, the death shall not constitute a culpable homicide. For all legal purposes, the cause of death shall be attributed to the child's pathology or immaturity (i.e., natural causes), not to the act of delivery which was performed to resolve a mortal threat. This section provides a complete legal defense against any charge of homicide for the medical professionals involved.

---

**Section 8: Murder**

Culpable homicide is murder where the person who causes the death of a human being:
(a) means to cause their death; or
(b) means to cause them bodily harm that they know is likely to cause their death, and is reckless whether death ensues or not.

---

**Section 9: Classification of Murder**

(1) Murder is first-degree murder or second-degree murder.

(2) Murder is first-degree murder when it is planned and deliberate.

(3) Without limiting the generality of subsection (2), murder is also first-degree murder when the victim is a peace officer acting in the course of their duties, or when the death is caused by a person while committing or attempting to commit another serious offence, including:
    (a) treason;
    (b) kidnapping;
    (c) sexual assault or aggravated sexual assault; or
    (d) a terrorist act.

(4) All murder that is not first-degree murder is second-degree murder.

---

**Section 10: Punishment for Murder and Manslaughter**

(1) Every person who commits first-degree murder or second-degree murder shall be sentenced to imprisonment for life.

(2) For a person sentenced to life imprisonment for first-degree murder, the period of parole ineligibility shall be twenty-five years.

(3) For a person sentenced to life imprisonment for second-degree murder, the period of parole ineligibility shall be determined by the court and shall be no less than ten years and no more than twenty-five years.

(4) Every person who commits manslaughter is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for life.

(5) **Clarification:** The sentencing provisions in this section are subject to the specific mandatory sentences prescribed in **Section 4 of this Act (Heinous Crimes Against a Child)**.

---

(1) A person commits an assault when, without the consent of another person, they apply force intentionally to that other person, directly or indirectly.

(2) An assault is a **simple assault** and is punishable by a term not exceeding two years.

(3) An assault is an **assault causing bodily harm** if it results in any hurt or injury that interferes with the health **or bodily integrity** of the person. It is punishable by a term not exceeding ten years.

(4) An assault is an **aggravated assault** if it wounds, maims, disfigures, or endangers the life of the person. It is punishable by a term not exceeding fourteen years.

# Foundations of the Criminal Law Act

---

### PREAMBLE

WHEREAS the **National Covenant** establishes that the purpose of just government is to serve as God's instrument to restrain evil and to commend what is good;

AND WHEREAS the **Charter of Immutable Principles** establishes absolute limits on the power of the state and guarantees the rights of the accused;

NOW THEREFORE, this Legislature enacts the following foundational criminal law for the nation, to be interpreted in a manner consistent with the principles of Justice, Mercy, and the Sanctity of Life. **For greater clarity, this Preamble shall serve as a guide to the interpretation of this Act and shall not be construed to create any substantive right or defence in any criminal proceeding.**

### PART I: GENERAL PRINCIPLES

**Section 1: Basis of Criminal Responsibility**

(1) A person is not guilty of an offence unless their conduct is proscribed by law and their guilt is proven beyond a reasonable doubt in a fair and public trial.

(2) Every offence requires proof of two elements:
    (a) an *actus reus*, being a voluntary act, or **an omission where there exists a pre-existing legal duty to act. Such a duty may be established by statute, by contract, by virtue of a special relationship such as that between a parent and child, or by one's own actions in creating a situation of danger;** and
    (b) a *mens rea*, being a guilty mind or the intent to commit the prohibited act.

(3) A person shall not be held criminally responsible for an act committed under duress of a direct and imminent threat of death or grievous bodily harm **to themselves or another person**.

(4) A person who, by reason of a severe mental disorder, was incapable of appreciating the nature of their act or knowing that it was morally wrong, shall be found not criminally responsible. **The party raising this issue must prove it on a balance of probabilities.** The disposition of such a case shall prioritize the safety of the public and the provision of appropriate medical care under the supervision of an independent Board of Review.

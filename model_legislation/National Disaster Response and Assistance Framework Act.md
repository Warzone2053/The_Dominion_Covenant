# The National Disaster Response and Assistance Framework Act

---

### PREAMBLE

WHEREAS the principle of **subsidiarity**, as established in the **Constitution of Government**, requires that governance be exercised at the lowest competent level;

AND WHEREAS catastrophic natural disasters may inflict suffering and devastation on a scale that exceeds the capacity of a single provincial government to remedy;

AND WHEREAS the people of the nation are united by a common bond of charity and mutual obligation to assist their fellow citizens in times of extreme hardship;

AND WHEREAS the absolute authority of the Legislature over the appropriation of public funds must be maintained, even during a crisis, to prevent executive overreach;

NOW THEREFORE, this Legislature enacts a permanent framework to govern the process of federal disaster assistance, ensuring that any such aid is provided in a manner that is swift, effective, and constitutionally sound.

### PART III: FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE MECHANISMS

**Section 6: The Two-Stage Financial Response**

(1) The federal financial response shall proceed in two distinct stages to ensure both immediate relief and long-term fiscal accountability:
    (a) **Stage One: The Contingency Fund Release, for immediate, life-sustaining needs.**
    (b) **Stage Two: The Emergency Relief Appropriation Act, for large-scale, long-term recovery and rebuilding.**

**Section 7: Stage One - The National Disaster Relief Contingency Fund**

(1) There is hereby established in the national treasury a dedicated, non-lapsable fund to be known as the **National Disaster Relief Contingency Fund**.

(2) The Prime Minister may, upon receiving a Formal Request for Federal Assistance, immediately petition the **National Defense Council (NDC)** for an emergency release from this Fund.

(3) A release of funds requires the approval of a **majority of the full membership of the NDC**. The authorization shall be for a specific, non-discretionary amount, calculated as follows:
    (a) For a disaster affecting a single province, the release shall be **ten percent (10%)** of the Fund's current balance.
    (b) For a disaster affecting multiple provinces simultaneously, the release shall be **twenty-five percent (25%)** of the Fund's current balance.

(4) These funds are designated exclusively for the purposes of evacuation, temporary shelter, and the provision of life-sustaining food, water, and medical care, and shall be disbursed by the Federal Support Coordinator.

**Section 8: Stage Two - The Emergency Relief Appropriation Act**

(1) The appropriation of any additional federal funds requires the passage of a specific **Emergency Relief Appropriation Act** by the Legislature.

(2) Such a bill shall clearly state the total amount appropriated and shall allocate those funds among the categories established in **Section 9** of this Act.

**Section 9: Financial Assistance Categories**

(1) The established categories for which the Legislature may appropriate funds are:
    (a) Critical Public Infrastructure Grants.

(2) Any reimbursement paid to an Assisting Province under an Emergency Relief Appropriation Act shall be calculated strictly according to this schedule.

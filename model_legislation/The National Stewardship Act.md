# The National Stewardship Act

---

### PREAMBLE

Pursuant to the mandate established in **Article V, Section 2 of the Constitution of Government**, this Act establishes the permanent, binding, and operational rules that govern the economic and fiscal life of the nation.

For greater clarity, this statute is a **Framework Act** as defined in **Article II of the Constitution of Government**. It is subordinate only to the **Charter of Immutable Principles** and the **Constitution of Government**, and its provisions have supremacy over all other ordinary legislation.

### PART I: THE FISCAL STATE OF THE NATION

1.  **Fiscal State Mechanism.** To ensure both discipline in times of prosperity and stability in times of crisis, the fiscal operation of the government shall be governed by three defined Fiscal States. The transition between these states shall be automatic and based on objective, publicly reported economic indicators as calculated by the independent office of the Chief Statistician of Canada.

2.  **State 1: Normal Operation.** This is the default state of the nation's finances.
    (a) **Rule:** The government's annual operational budget must be balanced.
    (b) **Financing:** Deficit spending is prohibited.

3.  **State 2: State of Fiscal Stress.**
    (a) **Automatic Trigger:** This state is declared automatically if the nation experiences two consecutive quarters of negative growth in the National Consumption Base (NCB) and a sustained rise in national unemployment exceeding one point five percent (1.5%) over a six-month period.
    (b) **Rules:**
        (i) The balanced budget mandate is temporarily suspended.
        (ii) The government may run a deficit for operational expenditures, but this deficit shall not exceed **one point five percent (1.5%)** of the nation's most recently published Gross Domestic Product.
        (iii) Any such deficit shall be financed exclusively through the issuance of publicly traded, short-term **"Recovery Bonds."**
    (c) **Automatic Exit:** This state automatically reverts to "Normal Operation" after two consecutive quarters of positive NCB growth and a sustained decline in the national unemployment rate.

4.  **State 3: State of Fiscal Crisis.**
    (a) **Automatic Trigger:** This state is declared automatically if the nation experiences a contraction in the NCB exceeding five percent (5%) in a single year and a sustained rise in national unemployment exceeding three percent (3.0%).
    (b) **Rules:**
        (i) The deficit limit is raised to a maximum of **five percent (5.0%)** of GDP.
        (ii) The Legislature may, by a three-quarters supermajority vote in both houses, authorize controlled draws from the **National Emergency Fund**.
    (c) **Automatic Exit and Recovery:** This state automatically reverts to a "State of Fiscal Stress" once the crisis triggers are no longer met. Following the crisis, a mandatory **"Crisis Recovery Surcharge"** on all federal revenues shall be enacted by the Legislature until all "Recovery Bonds" are retired and the National Emergency Fund is fully replenished.

### PART II: FEDERAL REVENUE LIMITATIONS

1.  **The Federal Tax Base.** The federal government may levy a direct tax on the income of individuals and corporations, and may levy a tax on national consumption, subject to the limitations herein.

2.  **The Dual-Cap Revenue Foundation.** To ensure revenue stability and prevent dependence on any single economic indicator, the total annual revenue from all forms of federal taxation is subject to a dual cap.
    (a) **Cap 1: The Stability Anchor.** Federal tax revenue shall not exceed **seven point five percent (7.5%)** of the most recently published **National Assessed Land Value (NALV)**. The NALV shall be calculated annually by the independent office of the **Chief Statistician of Canada** and shall represent the total unimproved value of all privately held land.
    (b) **Cap 2: The Economic Activity Gauge.** Federal tax revenue shall not exceed **ten percent (10%)** of the most recently published **National Consumption Base (NCB)**. The NCB shall be calculated annually by the Chief Statistician and represent the total value of all final goods and services sold within the economy.
    (c) **The Governing Rule:** In any fiscal year, the total federal tax revenue collected shall not exceed the **LOWER** of the two caps.

3.  **Fiscal Responsibility Ratchet.** So long as the total national debt exceeds twenty percent (20%) of the NALV, the NALV cap referenced in clause 2(a) shall be lowered to a maximum of **six percent (6.0%)**. The full seven point five percent (7.5%) cap shall only be available when the national debt is below this threshold.

### PART III: THE NATIONAL STEWARDSHIP DIVIDEND

1.  **Principle of Citizen Ownership.** Recognizing that the nation's natural resources are the common inheritance of the people, the net income derived from their use shall be returned directly to the citizens as a dividend of their ownership.

2.  **Mechanism of the Dividend.**
    (a) There is hereby established the **National Stewardship Dividend**, to be paid annually in equal shares to every adult citizen of the nation.
    (b) The source of this dividend shall be "Stewardship Revenue"—the net income generated from the profitable management of federal assets.

3.  **Distribution Based on Fiscal State.** The allocation of Stewardship Revenue shall be determined by the prevailing Fiscal State of the nation:
    (a) **During a State of Normal Operation:** Fifty percent (50%) of all Stewardship Revenue shall be used to pay down the principal of any outstanding national debt (such as Recovery Bonds). The remaining fifty percent (50%) shall be distributed as the National Stewardship Dividend. If no national debt exists, the full one hundred percent (100%) shall be distributed.
    (b) **During a State of Fiscal Stress or a State of Fiscal Crisis:** One hundred percent (100%) of all Stewardship Revenue shall be distributed as an emergency National Stewardship Dividend to provide direct and immediate economic relief to every household.

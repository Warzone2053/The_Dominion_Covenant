# Memorandum on the Master Principle of a Covenanted State: The Preservation of Life

---

### PREAMBLE

The first and most sacred duty of a Covenanted State is not to create prosperity, nor to guarantee happiness, but to guard the gift of life. All other functions of government are secondary to this primary, non-negotiable mandate. A state that fails in this duty has failed in its entire purpose and has forfeited its moral right to govern.

This memorandum will articulate the theological and philosophical reasoning behind the Dominion Covenant's absolute commitment to the preservation of life, from fertilization to natural death. It will demonstrate why this principle is not merely a policy preference, but is the logical and necessary consequence of a nation founded in submission to the sovereignty of God. It will further explain how this commitment, including the **prudential abolition of capital punishment**, represents a total rejection of the modern secular state's usurpation of divine authority, which has inevitably rendered it an arbiter of life's value and, therefore, an agent of death.

### I. The Divine Endowment of Life (Imago Dei)

The Dominion Covenant does not recognize a "right to life" that is granted by the state, created by a constitution, or negotiated by a society. Instead, it recognizes a single, foundational truth: **life is a divine endowment.**

The legal and moral force of **Article 1 of the Core Immutable Principles** flows from the theological doctrine of *Imago Dei*—the biblical revelation that all human beings are created "in the image of God" (Genesis 1:27). This is the source of life's sanctity. Human life is not sacred because it is useful, wanted, or "viable." It is sacred because it bears the indelible mark of its Creator.

Therefore, the state has no authority to extinguish what it did not create. The authority over life and death belongs to God alone. The state's role is not that of a sovereign granting a privilege, but that of a steward guarding a treasure that is not its own.

### II. The Limited and Delegated Authority of the State

Because life is a divine endowment, the state's power in relation to it is strictly limited and delegated. The state acts as God's "servant" (*diakonos*), as described in Romans 13, given authority for two purposes only: to protect the innocent and to punish the guilty.

This delegated authority includes the power of the "sword"—the right to use lethal force as an "avenger who carries out God's wrath on the wrongdoer." The Scriptures authorize the state to use this ultimate power to punish the crime of murder.

The Dominion Covenant, however, makes a conscious and profound **prudential judgment**. While acknowledging the state's *delegated authority* to enact capital punishment, it **constitutionally forbids its use**. This is not a denial of justice, but an affirmation of a higher stewardship, for two critical reasons:

1.  **The Irrevocability of Human Error:** A human justice system is fallible. It can, and does, make mistakes. If the state wrongfully imprisons an innocent person, that is a grievous injustice that can be remedied. The person can be exonerated and released. If the state executes an innocent person, it commits a state-sanctioned murder that is an absolute, irreversible, and eternal stain. A Covenanted State, which lives in the fear of God and is acutely aware of its own imperfection, must forbear from wielding a power its fallible hands can never undo.

2.  **The Fulfillment of Justice by Other Means:** The abolition of capital punishment does not mean a failure to punish evil. The Covenant replaces it with a sentence of **imprisonment for the full remainder of the convicted person's natural life, without possibility of parole.** This sentence fulfills the core duties of justice: it provides retribution by permanently removing the murderer from society, it protects the public absolutely, and it powerfully denounces the crime. The state still bears the sword against the wrongdoer, but it chooses a form of justice that upholds its duty without risking an irredeemable sin against the innocent.

### III. The Secular State as Arbiter of Death: The Fruit of the Genesis 3:5 Principle

The modern secular state is founded on the Serpent's lie from the Garden of Eden: "you will be like God, knowing good and evil" (Genesis 3:5). This principle of human autonomy is the wellspring of the Culture of Death.

When Man declares himself to be the sovereign source of law, he inevitably claims the power to judge the value of a life. This has led directly to the twin abominations of the modern age:

*   **Abortion:** Is the pre-born child inconvenient? The secular state simply redefines the **innocent** child as non-life, sanctioning its destruction.
*   **Euthanasia:** Is the elderly or sick person a burden? The secular state redefines the **innocent** person's life as not worth living, offering death as a "solution."

Both acts flow from the same poisoned source: a state that believes it has the authority to judge the value of an **innocent** life.

### IV. The Great Distinction: Forbearance for the Guilty, Absolute Protection for the Innocent

Herein lies the moral and logical consistency of the Dominion Covenant. The decision to abolish capital punishment and the decision to prohibit abortion are not in conflict; they are two sides of the same coin of profound reverence for life.

*   The decision to forbear from executing the **guilty** is a **prudential choice** about the *method* of justice, born of humility and a fear of irrevocable error. It is a state acknowledging its own fallibility before God.

*   The decision to kill the **innocent** (through abortion or euthanasia) is a **sovereign usurpation** of God's authority. It is a state claiming for itself the power to define who is and is not worthy of life.

A servant may wisely choose a less final tool to carry out his master's command to maintain order. But a servant may never, under any circumstance, turn and kill his master's innocent children. To do the first is prudence; to do the second is rebellion.

### V. The Constitutional Distinction Between Care and Treatment

This profound reverence for life extends to its end. The Covenant's absolute prohibition on causing death is not a mandate for medical tyranny. For this reason, **Article 1, Section 4 of the Core Immutable Principles** establishes a critical legal and moral distinction:

*   **Medical Treatment:** A citizen has an absolute right to refuse any medical procedure designed to cure a disease. This is the right to allow an underlying pathology to run its natural course.
*   **Ordinary Care:** The provision of hydration and nutrition is not a "medical procedure"; it is the basic sustenance necessary to sustain any life. The intentional withdrawal of this care to cause death is a prohibited act of euthanasia.

This distinction ensures the state protects life without violating the conscience of the individual.

### VI. The Preservation of Life as the Foundation of All Other Rights

All other rights and liberties enumerated in the Dominion Covenant—freedom of speech, property, conscience, and self-defense—are downstream from the master principle of life's preservation. They are meaningless if the state can arbitrarily extinguish the life of the person who is to exercise them.

Therefore, the unwavering, unapologetic, and absolute defense of every **innocent** human life is not one issue among many. It is the central pillar upon which the entire edifice of a just and free society is built. The state's cautious, humble, and non-irreversible approach to punishing even the **guilty** is the ultimate proof of this commitment. It is the first and final test of a nation's faithfulness to its Covenant with God.

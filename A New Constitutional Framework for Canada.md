# Project Overview: A New Constitutional Framework for Canada

## 1. Core Identity: A Tribunician-Confessional Republic

This project designs a new system of government for Canada, best described as a **Tribunician-Confessional Republic**.

*   **Confessional:** The nation is founded on a declared moral framework derived from the Holy Bible. Its laws and public identity are explicitly grounded in this religious and moral tradition, rather than in secularism.
*   **Tribunician:** The system creates a unique fourth branch of government—the **Citizen's Oversight Tribune**—composed of citizens selected by lottery. This body acts as a permanent, non-partisan check on the entire political class, with powers of investigation and ratification, ensuring the state remains accountable to the people it serves.

## 2. Guiding Philosophy

All articles of the constitution are built upon four foundational principles:
1.  **A Biblical Moral Framework:** The ultimate source of the nation's morality and law.
2.  **Individual Liberty and Responsibility:** Respect for God-given freewill, rights, and duties.
3.  **Skepticism of Concentrated Power:** A commitment to diffusing and checking authority.
4.  **Limited Government and Fiscal Prudence:** A belief that the state's role must be strictly and constitutionally limited.

## 3. Constitutional Architecture

The framework consists of two distinct documents:

### Document A: The Charter of Immutable Principles
*(The nation's permanent, unamendable soul)*

*   **Article 1: The Sanctity of Life:** Establishes life as sacred from conception to natural death, prohibiting euthanasia, assisted suicide, and capital punishment.
*   **Article 2: Freedom of Religion and Worship:** Guarantees absolute freedom of conscience while recognizing Christianity as the nation's foundational moral code.
*   **Article 3: The Nature of the Family and Marriage:** Defines marriage as between one man and one woman, establishes strong parental rights, and sets a high age of medical majority to protect minors.
*   **Article 4: Freedom of Speech and Truthful Expression:** Protects robust speech with specific, narrow exceptions (defamation, obscenity, etc.).
*   **Article 5: Property, Stewardship, and Sound Money:** Establishes property rights, a hard 10% cap on federal taxation (as a share of GDP), and mandates balanced operational budgets.
*   **Article 6: The Right of the People to Keep and Bear Arms:** Guarantees an absolute right to own conventional arms for self-defense, with specific prohibitions on registries and confiscation.
*   **Article 7: The Citizen's Oversight Tribune:** Creates the powerful, citizen-led oversight body to ensure government transparency and accountability.

### Document B: The Constitution of Government
*(The nation's operational machinery, amendable with great difficulty)*

*   **Article I: Amendment Process:** Requires a three-stage process: a 2/3 legislative supermajority, ratification by 2/3 of the provinces, and a national binding referendum.
*   **Article II: Local and Municipal Governance:** Built on the principle of subsidiarity.
    *   **Powers:** Manages strictly local affairs (roads, sanitation, local police).
    *   **Finance:** Taxation is limited to voter-approved property taxes and direct user fees.
    *   **Direct Democracy:** Citizens have the power of initiative to force referendums.
*   **Article III: Provincial Government:**
    *   **Section 1: Administration of Justice:** This section is highly fortified to prevent political abuse.
        *   **Separation of Powers:** Criminal prosecutions are removed from political control and given to an independent **Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP)**. The political Attorney General is restricted to civil matters.
        *   **Police Autonomy:** Provincial standards for municipal police are set by an independent commission, with a high bar and an appeal process to prevent forced provincial takeovers.
        *   **Judicial Appointments:** A robust, multi-stage process ensures judges are independent and chosen on merit:
            1.  An independent **Judicial Council** (judges, DPP, lawyers) vets and creates a shortlist.
            2.  An **all-party Legislative Committee** holds public hearings and confirms nominees.
            3.  The **Provincial Executive** selects one candidate from the confirmed list.
            4.  The **Citizen's Oversight Tribune** provides the final, binding ratification with a supermajority vote.

## 4. Current Status and Next Steps

The philosophical foundation and the core principles are complete. The machinery of government is being built from the ground up, starting with local government and moving to provincial.

- **COMPLETED:** Local Government (Article II), Provincial Administration of Justice (Article III, Section 1).
- **NEXT STEP:** Draft and fortify **Article III, Section 2: Healthcare**, ensuring its structure is consistent with the principles of the Immutable Charter.

# The Dominion Covenant

---

### PREAMBLE

> We, the people of Canada, standing in the sight of God to secure a legacy of faith, liberty, and justice, do hereby consecrate this **Dominion Covenant** as our supreme and binding charter.
>
> Let it be known that this Covenant is one whole, drawing its **unyielding strength** from the *Core Immutable Principles*, its **ordered form** from the *Constitution of Government*, and its **moral soul** from the *National Covenant*.
>
> For these three are one: the foundation, the framework, and the heart of the nation. Let no authority put asunder what is here joined, for a nation not founded on truth, not ordered by law, and not guided by virtue will surely perish from the earth.

# The Constitution of Government

---

### PREAMBLE
This document establishes the structure, powers, and procedures of the government of Canada. It is the highest operational law of the land and is subordinate only to the Charter of Immutable Principles. All articles herein must be interpreted in a manner consistent with the Charter.

---

### ARTICLE I: AMENDMENT PROCESS

An amendment to this Constitution may only be passed with the approval of:
1.  A two-thirds supermajority vote in the national Legislature.
2.  Ratification by the legislatures of at least two-thirds (7 of 10) of the provinces.
3.  Final confirmation by a national, binding referendum in which a majority of citizens approve the change.

---

### ARTICLE II: LOCAL AND MUNICIPAL GOVERNANCE

1.  **The Principle of Subsidiarity:** To ensure that governance remains as close to the people as possible, the principle of subsidiarity is hereby established. This means that matters ought to be handled by the smallest, lowest, or least centralized competent authority. Powers shall only be granted to a higher level of government if they cannot be effectively performed at a lower level.

2.  **Charter and Powers of Municipalities:** Communities may, by a local referendum, establish a chartered Municipal government. These governments shall have the authority to manage local affairs and services, specifically: (a) local roads, water, and sanitation; (b) local policing and by-law enforcement; (c) local parks and libraries; (d) land use and zoning; (e) local emergency services.

3.  **Municipal Taxation and Finance:** The power of a Municipal government to levy taxes shall be strictly limited to property taxes and direct user fees. The property tax rate shall be set annually by a binding referendum of the citizens of the municipality. To be enacted, the proposed rate must be approved by a **three-fifths (60%) majority** of those voting. All municipal budgets must be balanced annually.

4.  **The Citizen's Initiative:**
    (a) **Initiation:** By gathering a petition signed by five percent (5%) of the local electorate, the citizens of any municipality can propose a new law or major spending project to be put to a binding public referendum.
    (b) **Public Review and Fiscal Note:** Before any such referendum is held, the municipal government shall be required to conduct and publish an impartial **"Fiscal and Legal Impact Review,"** which must be attached to the ballot information provided to all voters.
    (c) **Passage Requirement:** To be enacted, any measure proposed by a Citizen's Initiative must be approved by a **three-fifths (60%) majority** of those voting in the referendum.

5.  **Provincial Pre-eminence on Critical Infrastructure:** The provincial government may override municipal zoning to build critical infrastructure (major highways, power grids, pipelines) that serves multiple communities. To do so, it must declare the project a "Provincial Priority" and provide special compensation to the affected municipality.

6.  **Provincial Role in Fiscal Stability:** The provincial government shall have the authority to establish a minimum municipal property tax rate and to administer a Provincial Equalization Fund to ensure a baseline of essential services across all communities.

7.  **Standards for Law Enforcement:** Municipalities shall manage their own police services, but the provincial government is responsible for setting and enforcing uniform, province-wide standards for training, conduct, and rules of engagement.

8.  **Supremacy of the Charter:** No municipal action may infringe upon the rights and principles established in the Charter of Immutable Principles. The provincial courts have the jurisdiction to strike down any such action.

---

### ARTICLE III: PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT

**Section 1: Administration of Justice**

1.  **Provincial Judiciary and Its Structure:**
    (a) Each provincial legislature is hereby granted the authority to establish and maintain the provincial courts, which shall include trial-level courts and a provincial court of appeal. These courts shall adjudicate all matters of law within the province, subordinate only to the Supreme Court of Canada.
    (b) The power to organize the courts is strictly limited to matters of judicial administration. This includes establishing rules of procedure, managing judicial caseloads and schedules, and determining the number and location of courthouses based on publicly auditable data regarding population and caseload needs.
    (c) The creation of specialized courts or judicial divisions is permitted only for the purpose of administrative efficiency in distinct areas of law, such as family or commercial law. The creation of any court or tribunal with a mandate focused on a specific political or ideological matter is explicitly prohibited.
    (d) No courthouse or judicial service may be closed or significantly reduced for punitive reasons. Any proposal to close a courthouse must be supported by a public report demonstrating a sustained lack of caseload, and the decision must be approved by the Provincial Judicial Council.

2.  **Provincial Policing Standards and Municipal Autonomy:**
    (a) The provincial government has the duty to establish province-wide minimum standards for municipal police services to ensure public safety, professional conduct, and the protection of constitutional rights.
    (b) These standards shall be developed and maintained by a "Provincial Police Standards Commission," an independent body composed of representatives from the provincial government, municipal governments, and provincial police chiefs' associations, and chaired by a nominee appointed by the Provincial Judicial Council. The standards shall be public documents.
    (c) The scope of these standards is limited to matters of recruitment, training in core competencies, use-of-force policies, and rules of professional conduct. No standard may be used to impose a specific political or social ideology upon a municipal police service.
    (d) Enforcement of these standards shall follow a graduated and transparent process. If a municipal service is found to be non-compliant, the province must first provide a formal notice and a reasonable period for remediation.
    (e) If a dispute arises over compliance or if a municipality believes a standard is unreasonable, the municipality has the right to appeal to the Provincial Judicial Council for a binding ruling.
    (f) The province may only assume temporary administrative control of a municipal police service under extraordinary circumstances, upon a finding by the Provincial Judicial Council that the service has suffered a catastrophic failure of conduct or capability that poses a direct and imminent threat to the life and liberty of its citizens, and that the municipality has failed to remedy the situation. Any such administrative control shall be for a fixed term and subject to review by the Council.

3.  **Provincial Director of Public Prosecutions:**
    (a) Each province shall establish the office of the Provincial Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), which shall be an independent and non-partisan officer of the Legislature. The DPP shall be responsible for initiating, managing, and overseeing all criminal prosecutions within the provincial territory.
    (b) The DPP shall be appointed for a single, non-renewable ten-year term. The appointment must be approved by a two-thirds supermajority vote of the provincial legislature. The DPP can only be removed from office prior to the end of their term for gross misconduct or incapacity, following an investigation and a subsequent vote of no confidence requiring a three-quarters supermajority of the legislature.
    (c) In the exercise of their prosecutorial functions, the DPP shall not be subject to the direction or control of any person or authority. They shall have the sole authority to issue and publish binding guidelines on prosecutorial discretion to ensure fairness and consistency.
    (d) There shall be a separate office of the Provincial Attorney General, who shall be a member of the executive cabinet. The Attorney General shall act as the chief legal advisor to the government and shall be responsible for all civil litigation involving the provincial state, but shall possess no authority over criminal prosecutions.

4.  **Appointment and Confirmation of Provincial Judges:**
    (a) A permanent Provincial Judicial Council is established in each province, composed of three voting members: the acting Chief Justice of the province, the Provincial Director of Public Prosecutions, and a representative selected by the provincial Law Society.
    (b) The Council's sole mandate is to identify and evaluate candidates based on merit, defined as demonstrable legal knowledge, professional experience, and judicial temperament. Consideration of a candidate's political affiliation or expressed ideology is prohibited.
    (c) When a judicial vacancy arises, the Council shall submit a list of not less than three and not more than five highly qualified nominees to a permanent, all-party Judicial Appointments Committee of the provincial legislature. The Council shall provide the Committee with a detailed report justifying each nominee's inclusion.
    (d) This Legislative Committee shall hold public confirmation hearings for the nominees. Following these hearings, the Committee shall forward the list of all nominees it has confirmed to the provincial executive (the Premier or Cabinet).
    (e) The provincial executive shall select and formally nominate one candidate from the legislature's confirmed list.
    (f) **Advisory Report from the Public Tribune:** Upon nomination, the nominee's file shall be transmitted to the Office of the Public Tribune. The Tribune's Office shall produce its "Report on Judicial Fitness," as defined in Article 10, which shall be made public and delivered to the provincial Legislature.
    (g) **Final Confirmation by the Legislature:** The final appointment of a judge requires confirmation by a two-thirds supermajority vote of the full provincial Legislature. This confirmation vote may only be held after the Tribune's "Report on Judicial Fitness" has been publicly available for a minimum of fourteen days to ensure adequate time for legislative and public review.

**Section 2: Healthcare**

1.  **Supreme Governing Principles:** All provincial laws, funding, and administration of healthcare are subordinate to the Charter of Immutable Principles.
    (a) The purpose of the healthcare system is the preservation of life. Accordingly, any **act or deliberate omission** whose foreseeable consequence is the death of a human being prior to their natural death is prohibited. This prohibition includes, but is not limited to, abortion, euthanasia, assisted suicide, and the **withholding of hydration, nutrition, or other care that is standard for a patient's condition**. This clause does not abridge the right of an individual to refuse medical treatment for themselves.
    (b) The right of parents to direct the healthcare of their minor children is paramount. In any case of disagreement between parents, a court's jurisdiction is limited to determining which parent's proposed course of action most closely aligns with preserving the child's life and their **biologically determined sex and its corresponding pubertal development**.
    (c) Any person who performs a procedure proscribed by Article 3.4 of the Charter on a person below the age of medical majority shall be subject to criminal penalties, which must include, as a mandatory minimum, the **permanent revocation of any state-issued professional license**. Any institution where such a procedure is performed shall be subject to substantial financial penalties and a **mandatory minimum five-year ineligibility for any form of public funding**.

2.  **Structure of the Healthcare System:** The provincial healthcare system shall be a hybrid model.
    (a) **The Provincial Health Security Net:** A publicly funded system is established to guarantee access for all citizens to a defined basket of medical services for the diagnosis and treatment of **pathological disease or physical injury**. For the purpose of this Article, natural human processes, including but not limited to pregnancy, aging, and menopause, shall not be defined as a pathological disease or injury.
    (b) **The Private and Voluntary Sector:** The right of citizens to private medical care shall not be infringed. Any tax, fee, or regulation must be based on the **nature of the medical service provided, not on the corporate or financial structure of the provider**. No regulation may be imposed on a private facility that is not also imposed on a public facility providing the same service.

3.  **Administration and Standards:**
    (a) There is hereby established an independent **Provincial Health Standards Commission**. The Commission shall be composed of seven members serving single, non-renewable seven-year terms.
    (b) **Appointment and Removal Process:** The Commission shall be composed of: three members nominated by the Provincial Medical Association, two members nominated by the Council of Provincial Medical School Deans, and two members nominated by the acting Chief Justice of the province. The legislature may, by a two-thirds supermajority vote, create a confirmed list of candidates from these nominees. The final candidates must then be ratified by a two-thirds supermajority vote of the **Active Council of the Citizen's Oversight Tribune.** Commissioners can only be removed by the same process.
    (c) **Limited Mandate:** The Commission's mandate is strictly limited to: (i) defining and publishing the specific list of **procedures and treatments** covered by the Provincial Health Security Net; (ii) setting and enforcing province-wide standards for professional licensing and facility accreditation; and (iii) auditing health outcomes.

4.  **Fiscal Governance and Control:**
    (a) The list of covered procedures and treatments, herein referred to as the "Provincial Formulary," shall be a public document.
    (b) To prevent political coercion, the addition of any new procedure or treatment to the Provincial Formulary requires that the **legislature's ratification vote on the matter be a separate and distinct vote**, addressing only that single procedure or treatment. Approval requires a two-thirds supermajority.
    (c) To prevent sabotage through fiscal starvation, the total annual provincial budget for the Health Security Net must be, at minimum, equivalent to the previous year's budget adjusted for population growth and the **Provincial Health Price Index (PHPI)**. The PHPI shall be an official metric calculated annually by the independent Provincial Statistics Agency to specifically measure the inflation of medical goods and services. A reduction below this constitutional floor requires a three-quarters supermajority vote.

---

### ARTICLE IV: FEDERAL PUBLIC FINANCE

**Section 1: National Project Bonds**

1.  The Legislature may, under strict limitations, be granted the authority to fund specific, large-scale capital projects through the issuance of National Project Bonds, which shall be offered for voluntary purchase by the public.

2.  The Legislature shall pass a **National Project Bond Act** to define the specific procedures, but this Act must adhere to the following constitutional limitations:
    (a) All such bonds must be approved by a national, binding referendum.
    (b) The Act shall establish at least two classes of bonds: one for revenue-generating projects and one for non-revenue strategic projects.
    (c) The approval threshold for issuing bonds for non-revenue strategic projects must require, at minimum, a three-quarters supermajority in the Legislature and a two-thirds supermajority in the national referendum.
    (d) The total outstanding principal of all bonds for non-revenue strategic projects may not exceed five percent (5%) of the nation's Gross Domestic Product.

---

### ARTICLE V: THE REGULATED MILITIA OF THE PROVINCES

1.  **Principle and Purpose:** Pursuant to the principle recognized in Article 9 of the Charter of Immutable Principles, a system of well-regulated provincial militias is hereby established to provide for the common defense and to render aid in civil emergencies.

2.  **Composition and Structure:**
    (a) Each province shall raise, train, and maintain its own Regulated Militia.
    (b) Enlistment in the militia shall be strictly voluntary for all citizens who have attained the age of twenty and are not otherwise disqualified from bearing arms under the Charter.
    (c) The standard term of enlistment shall be for a period of six years.

3.  **Member Obligations:** Members shall be obligated to attend regular, paid training, not to exceed one weekend per month and two weeks per year. Members are expected to maintain their own standard personal arms in a state of readiness.

4.  **Government Obligations:**
    (a) The federal government shall establish uniform standards for militia training and equipment to ensure interoperability.
    (b) The provincial government shall be responsible for the administration, recruitment, and command of its militia in peacetime.

5.  **Activation and Command Protocol:** The militia is a defensive and civil support force with strictly defined activation protocols.
    (a) **Provincial Activation:** The executive head of a province may call the provincial militia to active duty to respond to a catastrophic natural disaster or to suppress violent insurrection within that province's borders.
    (b) **Federal Activation:** The militia may only be called into federal service and placed under federal command after a State of Emergency has been declared under the protocols of Article 7, Clause 6(a) of the Charter.

6.  **Protocol for Limited Civil Assistance.**
    (a) The Legislature is empowered to pass laws enabling the temporary assignment of militia personnel and equipment to provide support to Provincial Civil Authorities for the purpose of preventing imminent death or grievous bodily harm.
    (b) Any law passed under this authority must establish two distinct pathways for authorization:
        (i) **The Standard Path:** For foreseeable situations, a request for assistance must originate from a Provincial Minister or their designated Deputy-Minister, who must make a sworn declaration that the conditions for assistance have been met.
        (ii) **The Exigent Path:** In a sudden, localized emergency where a delay would result in the loss of life, a Designated Local Emergency Chief (as defined by provincial law) may request the immediate deployment of militia assets.
    (c) **Accountability Protocol for the Exigent Path:** Upon making an exigent request, the Local Emergency Chief must notify the responsible Provincial Minister without delay. The Minister must, within 90 minutes of being notified, conduct a review and issue a formal Ratification or Revocation of the mission, assuming full responsibility via a sworn declaration if ratified.
    (d) **Absolute Prohibitions:** All assistance missions are subject to the non-negotiable limitation that militia personnel shall not perform any law enforcement or security functions.

7.  **Prohibition on Misuse:** The militia shall never be used for routine law enforcement. The federal government has no authority to activate, command, or disarm any provincial militia except during a constitutionally declared State of Emergency for national defense.

---

**Section 3: Powers and Responsibilities**

The Governor General's powers are strictly limited to those enumerated herein.

1.  **Constitutional Duties:**
    (a) **Appointing the Prime Minister:** Following a general election, or upon the resignation of a Prime Minister, the Governor General shall appoint as the new Prime Minister the individual who commands the confidence of the House of Commons. This duty is not discretionary.
    (b) **Giving Assent to Legislation:** The Governor General gives final assent to all bills lawfully passed by the Legislature. This act is largely ceremonial, signifying that a bill has completed the legislative process.
    (c) **The Power of Constitutional Remonstrance:**
        (i) There is hereby established a **Council of Constitutional Guardians**, composed of three retired justices of the Supreme Court, appointed by the Legislature to serve single, staggered nine-year terms. This Council's sole function is to provide confidential constitutional advice to the Governor General.
        (ii) If the Governor General has reason to believe a bill may violate the Charter of Immutable Principles, they may request a formal opinion from this Council.
        (iii) If the Council of Constitutional Guardians advises, in a public report, that the bill presents a **clear and direct conflict** with an Immutable Principle, the Governor General may withhold assent and return the bill to the Legislature with the Council's report attached. To override the remonstrance, the bill must be passed again by a three-quarters supermajority in both houses.
        (iv) The opinion of the Council of Constitutional Guardians is advisory only and shall have no binding force in any subsequent judicial proceeding before the Supreme Court of Canada.

1.  **Term of Office:** The Governor General shall serve for a single, non-renewable term of seven years.

2.  **Removal for Misconduct:** The Governor General may be removed from office only for gross misconduct or a severe violation of their oath. Removal requires a "Bill of Impeachment" passed by a three-quarters supermajority of both legislative houses, followed by a formal finding of fact by the full Supreme Court confirming the grounds for removal.

3.  **Removal for Incapacity:** A Governor General may be removed from office if they become permanently unable to discharge their duties due to physical or mental incapacity. This process is initiated by a unanimous resolution of the Council of National Order, which must then be ratified by a simple majority vote in both legislative houses. Upon ratification, the office is declared vacant, and the Governor General is deemed to have been honourably retired. This process may not be used for reasons of policy disagreement or political unpopularity.

4.  **Succession:** In the event of the Governor General's death, resignation, or removal, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court shall serve as Administrator of the Government until a new Governor General is appointed through the process defined in Section 2.

---

**Section 5: Oath of Office**

Before taking up their duties, the Governor General shall take the following oath, administered by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court:

> "I, [Name], do solemnly swear before Almighty God that I will faithfully and impartially execute the office of Governor General of Canada.

I will devote myself to the service of the nation and its people, seeking to embody the virtues of our National Covenant. So help me God."

---

### ARTICLE VII: THE NATIONAL LEGISLATURE

**Section 1: The House of Commons**

1.  **Principle of Individual Representation:** There is hereby established a House of Commons, which shall be the principal chamber of the National Legislature. It is the seat of the people's direct representation, where each member shall be accountable to their constituents and their conscience, free from the direction of any intermediary body.

2.  **Composition and Apportionment:**
    (a) The House of Commons shall be composed of a fixed number of **three hundred and fifty (350) members**. Each member shall represent a single electoral district.
    (b) Seats shall be apportioned among the provinces strictly on the basis of population ("representation by population"), as determined by a mandatory national census to be conducted every ten years.
    (c) Following each census, the number of seats allocated to each province shall be recalculated, and electoral districts shall be redrawn according to the process defined in this Article.

3.  **Electoral Districts and Independent Commissions:**
    (a) To prevent political manipulation of electoral boundaries, the task of drawing the map of electoral districts in each province shall be vested exclusively in an independent, non-partisan **Electoral Boundaries Commission**.
    (b) The Legislature shall, by law, establish the composition of these commissions, but they must be chaired by a sitting or retired judge and must include, at minimum, the province's chief statistician and chief geographer, or their equivalents. No elected official or registered agent of a political party may serve on a commission.
    (c) Each commission's mandate is to draw district boundaries that are, as nearly as is reasonable, equal in population, while respecting communities of interest and geographic coherence.

4.  **Electoral System and Candidacy:**
    (a) The system for electing members of the House of Commons must be designed to ensure, as far as is practicable, that every elected member has the support of a majority of the voters in their district. A system shall be deemed to meet this constitutional standard if it requires a candidate to secure more than fifty percent (50%) of the validly cast ballots to be declared elected. The Legislature is empowered to fulfill this requirement through a **Dominion Elections Act**, which may provide for a ranked-choice ballot system or a run-off election between the top two candidates. Simple plurality voting (First-Past-the-Post) is prohibited.
    (b) **Ballot Access:** A citizen shall be placed on the ballot for election in a district upon submitting a petition signed by no fewer than five hundred (500) electors residing within that district.
    (c) **Ballot Neutrality:** The ballot shall list only the candidate's name and the electoral district. No affiliation with or endorsement by any political party, association, or organization shall appear on the ballot.

5.  **Term of Office and Limitation of Service:**
    (a) The term of office for a member of the House of Commons shall be four years.
    (b) To ensure a constant renewal of representation and to prevent the formation of a permanent political class, no person shall serve as a member of the House of Commons for a cumulative total of more than **twelve (12) years**. Any period of service greater than two years shall be counted as a full four-year term for the purpose of this limitation.

6.  **Qualifications of Members:** To be eligible to serve as a member of the House of Commons, a person must be a citizen of Canada who has reached the age of twenty-one and is not otherwise disqualified from voting.

7.  **The Speaker:**
    (a) At the commencement of each new Parliament, the first order of business of the House of Commons shall be the election of a Speaker by a secret ballot of all members.
    (b) The Speaker shall preside over the proceedings of the House with absolute impartiality, and shall not participate in debate. They may vote only to break a tie. Upon election, the Speaker shall suspend their political affiliation for the duration of their term in the chair.

8.  **Election of the Prime Minister:** Following a general election, the House of Commons shall, after electing a Speaker, nominate and elect from among its own members a Prime Minister. This election shall be conducted by one or more secret ballots until one member receives the affirmative vote of a majority of the full House.

9.  **The Governing Accord:** To demonstrate a stable foundation for government, any candidate for Prime Minister may enter into a formal "Governing Accord" with any number of other members or informal caucuses.
    (a) This Accord shall be a public document, outlining the agreed-upon legislative priorities and the terms of support for the government.
    (b) To be considered binding, the Accord must be signed by the Prime Ministerial candidate and the supporting members, and shall be formally registered with the Office of the Speaker of the House.

10. **The Cabinet:** The Prime Minister shall nominate members of the House to serve as Ministers of the Crown. Each nominee must be individually confirmed by a majority vote of the House to form the Cabinet.

11. **The Principle of Constructive Confidence:** The Prime Minister and their government serve by commanding the confidence of the House. To ensure the stability of the nation, this confidence is subject to the following strict rule:
    (a) The House of Commons may only withdraw its confidence from a Prime Minister through a **"Constructive Motion of No Confidence."**
    (b) Such a motion must, in a single, indivisible question, both name the sitting Prime Minister to be removed and nominate a successor.
    (c) To be adopted, this motion must receive the affirmative vote of a majority of the full House of Commons.
    (d) If the motion is adopted, the sitting Prime Minister is immediately dismissed and the named successor is simultaneously appointed Prime Minister, ensuring there is no period of vacancy or instability. A simple motion of no confidence that does not name a successor is not in order and shall have no constitutional force.

12. **Power of the Purse:** All bills for raising revenue or appropriating public funds must originate in the House of Commons.

13. **Legislative Process and Agenda:**
    (a) To ensure fairness and access, the legislative agenda of the House of Commons shall be set by a **House Business and Agenda Committee**, chaired by the Speaker and composed of twenty-four members selected by lottery at the start of each session to serve a one-year term.
    (b) The formal rules of the House shall not grant any special status, funding, or privilege based on a member's affiliation with any informal caucus or faction. The offices of party whip and party leader are not recognized.

---

**Section 2: The Senate**

1.  **Principle and Purpose:** There is hereby established a Senate, which shall be the guardian of the provinces and the regions. Its purpose is to provide a powerful counterbalance to the principle of representation by population, ensuring that the distinct interests and character of every province, regardless of its size, are protected within the national government.

2.  **Composition and Equal Representation:**
    (a) The Senate shall be composed of **one hundred (100) members**, with each of the ten provinces having an equal delegation of **ten (10) Senators**.
    (b) This equality of representation is absolute and shall not be altered based on population changes.

3.  **Selection by Provincial Legislatures:**
    (a) Senators shall not be directly elected by the people but shall be chosen by the legislature of the province they represent. They are to act as ambassadors of their province's interests within the federal government.
    (b) The selection of a Senator requires a **two-thirds supermajority vote** of the provincial legislature. This is to ensure that a Senator has broad support and is not merely an agent of the provincial government's ruling party.

4.  **Term of Office and Staggered Terms:**
    (a) The term of office for a Senator shall be **eight years**. This longer term is intended to foster stability, institutional memory, and a long-term perspective, insulating the Senate from the immediate political passions that may influence the House of Commons.
    (b) Terms shall be staggered. Five of each province's ten Senators shall be selected every four years, ensuring continuity within each provincial delegation and the Senate as a whole.
    (c) To prevent the formation of a permanent political class, no person may serve as a Senator for more than two full terms (a cumulative total of sixteen years).

5.  **Qualifications of Members:** To be eligible to serve as a Senator, a person must be a citizen of Canada who has reached the age of thirty and has been a resident of the province they seek to represent for no fewer than five years prior to their selection.

6.  **Powers of the Senate:**
    (a) The Senate holds **co-equal legislative authority** with the House of Commons on all matters, except as specified herein. Any bill must be passed in identical form by both houses before it can be sent to the Governor General for assent.
    (b) The Senate may approve, amend, or reject any bill, including budgets and appropriations bills, passed by the House of Commons.
    (c) **Limitation:** The Senate may not originate bills whose primary purpose is to raise revenue through taxation or to appropriate public funds. This power resides exclusively with the House of Commons.
    (d) **Dispute Resolution:** If the two houses cannot agree on the text of a bill, a "Conference Committee" composed of an equal number of members from each house shall be formed to negotiate a compromise. The compromise text must then be approved by a majority vote in both houses.

---

**Section 3: Legislative Accountability and Compensation**

1.  **Principle of Service and Accountability:** Membership in the Legislature is a public trust, not a career. Compensation shall be structured to enable service, while performance shall be enforced through strict fiscal accountability.

2.  **Compensation Benchmark:**
    (a) The Legislature shall have no power to determine its own compensation. This power is vested exclusively in an **Independent Compensation Commission**, composed of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, the Public Tribune General, and the Chief Statistician of Canada.
    (b) The Commission shall convene every ten years to set the base compensation for a member of the House of Commons, pegging it to a senior, non-political public service rank. A Senator's compensation shall be set at ninety-five percent (95%) of this benchmark.

3.  **Fiscal Performance Modifier:** The base compensation for all members of the Legislature shall be subject to an annual modifier based on the final, audited budget of the national government:
    (a) **Surplus:** In any year the government records a budget surplus, compensation for the following year shall be increased by a five percent (5%) bonus.
    (b) **Deficit:** In any year the government records a budget deficit, compensation for the following year shall be decreased by a ten percent (10%) penalty.
    (c) This modifier is suspended only during a constitutionally declared State of Emergency.

4.  **Mandate Forfeiture for Budgetary Failure:**
    (a) The primary duty of the Legislature is to pass a balanced operational budget for the fiscal year.
    (b) If a budget has not received assent by the first day of the fiscal year, a thirty-day **"Accountability Period"** shall commence, during which all member compensation is suspended.
    (c) If no budget is passed and assented to by the end of this period, the mandate of the government is deemed forfeited. The Governor General shall immediately dissolve the House of Commons and call a new general election. Incumbent members shall receive no further compensation until a new House is elected and a budget is passed.

5.  **Transparency of Expenses:** The Legislature may provide for the reimbursement of legitimate, audited expenses necessary for public duties. All such claims shall be audited by the Office of the Public Tribune and published quarterly.

### ARTICLE VIII: THE SUPREME COURT OF CANADA

---

**Section 1: Mandate and Judicial Power**

1.  **The Supreme Judicial Authority.** The judicial power of Canada shall be vested in one Supreme Court. It shall be the highest court in the nation and the final guardian of the Charter of Immutable Principles and this Constitution of Government.

2.  **The Guardian's Duty.** The primary and solemn duty of the Supreme Court is to uphold and enforce the supremacy of the constitutional text. Its purpose is to ensure that all laws passed by the Legislature, all actions taken by the Executive, and all decisions made by lower courts are in strict conformity with the principles established in the Charter of Immutable Principles.

---

**Section 2: Composition and Qualifications**

1.  **Composition.** The Supreme Court shall consist of a Chief Justice and eight other Justices, for a total of nine members.

2.  **Qualifications.** To be eligible for appointment to the Supreme Court, a person must be a citizen of Canada, be a current or former judge of a provincial Court of Appeal or have at least fifteen years of standing at the bar of a province. Furthermore, they must, through their judicial record or public life, have demonstrated a history of fidelity to the constitutional principles upon which the nation is founded.

3.  **Statement of Constitutional Philosophy.** To be eligible for nomination, all candidates must submit a formal "Statement of Constitutional Philosophy." This sworn document must affirm their personal commitment to the principles of the Charter and their adherence to the Rule of Constitutional Supremacy as defined in Section 5 of this Article. This Statement shall be made public upon their nomination and shall serve as a permanent benchmark for their tenure on the Court.

---

**Section 3: Appointment Process**

The appointment of a Justice to the Supreme Court shall follow this strict, multi-stage process:

1.  **Nomination Pool.** When a vacancy arises, each Provincial Judicial Council (as established in Article III) may submit the name of one qualified candidate to the Supreme Court Nominating Commission.

2.  **The Supreme Court Nominating Commission.** There is hereby established a permanent Commission tasked with vetting candidates for the Supreme Court. It shall be composed of three members:
    (a) The Governor General.
    (b) The Public Tribune General.
    (c) The acting Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.

3.  **The Shortlist.** The Commission shall review the candidates from the provincial nomination pool and shall, by **unanimous consent**, select a shortlist of three nominees deemed most qualified to uphold the duties of the office. This shortlist shall be transmitted to the Prime Minister. Should the Commission be unable to achieve unanimity within sixty days of a vacancy arising, a shortlist may be produced by an affirmative vote of **two of the three members**. Any such non-unanimous shortlist must be accompanied by a public report from the dissenting member detailing their reasons for opposition.

4.  **Executive Nomination.** The Prime Minister shall nominate one candidate from the Commission's shortlist to fill the vacancy.

5.  **Senate Confirmation.** The final appointment is conditional upon confirmation by the Senate.
    (a) The Office of the Public Tribune shall prepare and publish its "Report on Judicial Fitness" for the nominee, which shall be delivered to the Senate.
    (b) The Senate shall hold public confirmation hearings.
    (c) Confirmation requires a **two-thirds supermajority vote** of the full Senate. If the nominee fails to be confirmed, the Prime Minister must select another candidate from the original shortlist.
    (d) **Confirmation Deadlock Protocol.** If the Senate fails to confirm any of the three nominees from a valid shortlist within ninety days of receiving the final name, a state of Constitutional Deadlock is declared. The Prime Minister may then recall any one of the three previously rejected nominees and, by presenting a formal "Petition of Last Resort" to the House of Commons, may call for a confirmation vote in that chamber. The nominee is confirmed upon receiving the affirmative vote of **a simple majority of the full House of Commons.** This is an extraordinary measure to ensure the continuity of the Court against legislative obstruction.

---

**Section 4: Tenure and Compensation**

1.  **Term of Office.** A Justice of the Supreme Court shall be appointed for a single, non-renewable term of **eighteen (18) years**.

2.  **Mandatory Retirement.** All Justices must retire upon reaching the age of seventy-five, regardless of their term's length.

3.  **Compensation.** A Justice's compensation shall be set by the Independent Compensation Commission and shall not be diminished during their term in office.

---

**Section 5: Jurisdiction and the Rule of Constitutional Supremacy**

1.  **Appellate Jurisdiction.** The Supreme Court shall have final appellate jurisdiction over all cases from the provincial courts of appeal. Its decisions are binding on all other courts in the nation.

2.  **Original Jurisdiction.** The Supreme Court shall have original jurisdiction to hear and decide disputes between the provinces, or between a province and the federal government.

3.  **The Rule of Constitutional Supremacy.** The Supreme Court's power of judicial review shall be strictly governed by the following principle:
    (a) The Court's sole function is to measure a statute or government action against the **plain meaning of the text** of the Charter of Immutable Principles and this Constitution.
    (b) The Court is explicitly prohibited from "discovering," "creating," or "implying" any new rights not enumerated in the text.
    (c) The Court shall not consider foreign law or "evolving social standards" when interpreting the Constitution. The meaning of the text is fixed and may only be altered by the amendment process defined herein. Any ruling that violates this clause shall be considered a dereliction of constitutional duty.

4.  **The Power of Constitutional Nullification.** When the Supreme Court, in a final judgment, finds that a law, regulation, or government action is in violation of the Charter of Immutable Principles or this Constitution, that law or action is hereby declared to be **null, void, and without legal force or effect** from the moment the judgment is rendered. All lower courts and government agencies are bound to immediately cease its enforcement.

---

**Section 6: Impeachment and Removal**

1.  A Justice of the Supreme Court may be removed from office only through impeachment.

2.  **Grounds for Impeachment.** The House of Commons shall have the sole power of impeachment, requiring a majority vote to charge a Justice with:
    (a) Gross personal or criminal misconduct; or
    (b) A willful and persistent pattern of jurisprudence that directly contravenes the **Rule of Constitutional Supremacy** as defined in Section 5, or that violates their sworn **Statement of Constitutional Philosophy.**

3.  The Senate shall have the sole power to try all impeachments. Conviction and removal from office require a **two-thirds supermajority vote** of the full Senate.

---

### ARTICLE IX: THE OFFICE OF THE PUBLIC TRIBUNE

---

#### **Section 1: Appointment and Confirmation of the Tribune General**

1.  **The Nominating Council.** The responsibility for nominating candidates for the office of Tribune General is vested exclusively in a special convocation of the **Council of National Order**. When a vacancy arises, the Council shall convene with the following composition:
    (a) The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Canada (Chair).
    (a) The Governor General of Canada.
    (c) The Speaker of the Upper House of the Legislature.
    (d) The Speaker of the Lower House of the Legislature.
    (e) The outgoing Tribune General, who shall serve in an advisory, non-voting capacity to ensure continuity of purpose. In the event the position is vacant due to death, removal, or if it is the inaugural appointment, the senior-most Justice of the Supreme Court shall serve in this advisory role instead.

2.  **Qualifications for Office.** To be eligible for nomination as Tribune General, a person must be a citizen of Canada and must possess a demonstrated record of unimpeachable integrity, non-partisanship, and professional excellence in a field relevant to the Office's mandate, such as law, forensic auditing, or major investigations. Furthermore, any person who has, within the preceding ten years, served as a member of the national Legislature, held a cabinet position, or been a registered agent for a political party is ineligible for nomination.

3.  **The Nomination Process.** The Council shall be charged with the permanent and ongoing duty of identifying and evaluating potential candidates for the office of Tribune General, maintaining at all times a confidential list of qualified individuals. When a vacancy arises, the Council shall draw from this list and its deliberations to nominate a single candidate. To ensure the highest degree of consensus for this vital role, the Council shall, by a **unanimous vote of its four voting members**, nominate a single candidate for the office of Tribune General. The Council's nomination shall be transmitted to the national Legislature, accompanied by a comprehensive public report detailing the nominee's qualifications and the Council's reasons for their unanimous selection.

4.  **Legislative Confirmation.** The final appointment is conditional upon confirmation by a joint session of both houses of the national Legislature.
    (a) The nominee shall appear before a joint committee of the House and Senate for public confirmation hearings.
    (b) Confirmation requires a **three-quarters supermajority vote** of all members present in the joint session. This high threshold is established to ensure the Tribune General takes office with the overwhelming and bipartisan confidence of the people's representatives.

5.  **Confirmation Deadlock Protocol.** If the Legislature fails to confirm the Council's nominee, the nomination is voided. The Council of National Order must then reconvene and, within ninety days, produce a new, single nominee by the same unanimous process. The Legislature cannot compel the Council to reconsider a failed nominee. This process shall continue until a candidate is successfully confirmed. This protocol is designed to ensure that neither the Council nor the Legislature can indefinitely obstruct the appointment through inaction or political intransigence.

6.  **Oath of Office.** Before assuming their duties, the Tribune General shall take the following oath, administered by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court in a public ceremony:
    > "I, [Name], do solemnly swear before Almighty God that I will faithfully, impartially, and fearlessly execute the office of Tribune General of Canada. I will be a steadfast guardian of the public trust against corruption, mismanagement, and waste. I will follow the evidence wherever it may lead, without favour to any person, party, or institution, and will dedicate myself wholly to the service of the Canadian people and the integrity of their government. So help me God."

---

#### **Section 2: Budgetary Independence and Fiscal Accountability**

1.  **Principle of Fiscal Independence.** The Office of the Public Tribune shall be fiscally independent from the legislative and executive branches of government. Its budget shall not be subject to the annual appropriations process of the Legislature, nor shall it be altered, delayed, or withheld by any government official or body except as provided for in this Article.

2.  **The Constitutional Funding Formula.** A dedicated and non-lapsable "Public Tribune Trust Fund" is hereby established in the national treasury. On the first day of each fiscal year, this Fund shall be automatically credited with an amount equal to **zero point two percent (0.2%)** of the figure published as "Total Expenses" in the **audited "Annual Financial Report of the Government of Canada"** for the preceding fiscal year.
    (a) Should any dispute arise over the calculation of this amount or the definitions used within the Annual Financial Report, the **Supreme Court of Canada shall have original jurisdiction to render a final and binding judgment.**
    (b) The non-lapsable status of the Fund allows the Office of the Public Tribune to carry over unspent balances from one year to the next, enabling the long-term planning required for complex, multi-year investigations.
    (c) **Initial Funding.** For the first fiscal year following the enactment of this Constitution, before a preceding year's audit is available, the Public Tribune Trust Fund shall be credited with a fixed sum, to be defined in the transitional provisions of this Constitution. This sum shall be deemed sufficient to establish the Office and begin its operations. The constitutional formula shall apply from the second fiscal year onward.

3.  **Supplemental Funding for Investigations of National Significance.** In extraordinary circumstances, where a single investigation is of such scale and complexity that it exceeds the capacity of the Office's annual budget, the Tribune General may petition the **full Supreme Court of Canada** for supplemental funding.
    (a) The petition must be made in a public session of the Court and must present compelling evidence demonstrating the necessity of the investigation and the specific reasons why the standard budget is insufficient.
    (b) If the Court, by a majority vote, finds that the matter constitutes an "Investigation of National Significance," it may issue a binding order directing the national treasury to release a specified, one-time supplemental appropriation directly to the Public Tribune Trust Fund. The Legislature shall have no power to veto or delay this court-ordered appropriation.

4.  **Fiscal Accountability.** The Office remains accountable for its use of public funds through a two-part annual audit, conducted by an independent, external auditing firm appointed by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.
    (a) **The Public Audit Report:** The primary audit, detailing all administrative, staffing, and non-sensitive operational expenditures of the Office, shall be made public in its entirety.
    (b) **The Sealed Security Annex:** A separate, sealed annex to the audit shall detail all expenditures related to sensitive ongoing investigations, the disclosure of which the Tribune General certifies could endanger national security or the physical safety of individuals. This sealed annex shall be delivered directly and exclusively to a **permanent three-member Special Committee of the Supreme Court**, which shall have the power to review the documents and, if necessary, investigate any expenditure it deems questionable. The annex shall not be made available to any member of the legislative or executive branches.

---

#### **Section 3: Powers of Investigation and Compulsory Process**

1.  **Authority to Examine and Inquire.** The Office of the Public Tribune is hereby granted the authority to conduct any investigation necessary to fulfill its mandate as defined in Article 10 of the Charter of Immutable Principles. In the course of a duly authorized investigation, the Tribune General or their designated investigators may examine witnesses, administer oaths or affirmations, and require the production of any books, records, documents, or other evidence deemed relevant to the inquiry.

2.  **The Power of Subpoena.** To compel the production of evidence, the Tribune General may issue subpoenas to any person or entity, including government officials, private citizens, and corporate bodies. A subpoena issued under this authority shall have the same legal force as one issued by a court of law, subject to the enforcement and review protocols herein.

3.  **Testimony Under Oath.** All testimony compelled by the Office of the Public Tribune shall be taken under oath or solemn affirmation. Knowingly providing false testimony to the Tribune in an official proceeding shall constitute the crime of bearing false witness and shall be subject to prosecution.

4.  **Judicial Enforcement and Review of Subpoenas.** The Office of the Public Tribune shall have no independent power to punish non-compliance.
    (a) A person or entity who has been served with a subpoena may apply to a judge of the provincial court to have the subpoena quashed or modified on the grounds that it is overly broad, seeks information not relevant to a legitimate investigation, or is otherwise an abuse of power.
    (b) If a person or entity refuses to comply with a subpoena, the Tribune General shall apply to a judge for a compliance order. Upon a showing that the subpoena was lawfully issued, the judge shall issue a court order compelling compliance.
    (c) Failure to obey the subsequent court order shall constitute contempt of court and shall be punishable by the court accordingly.

5.  **Constitutional and Legal Limitations on Investigative Powers.** The powers granted in this section are substantial and shall be exercised in strict conformity with all other provisions of this Constitution and the laws of the land.
    (a) The Tribune shall be bound by the right of any individual against compelled self-incrimination as established in Article 6 of the Charter of Immutable Principles.
    (b) The Tribune's power to compel evidence is subject to all common law and statutory privileges, including but not limited to attorney-client privilege. **A judge shall be the final arbiter of any dispute over a claim of privilege.**
    (c) The Tribune's power to compel evidence shall not be construed to authorize a physical search of a person's home or effects, for which a judicial warrant must be obtained by the appropriate law enforcement agency pursuant to Article 5 of the Charter.

6.  **Protocol for National Security Claims.** If the executive branch refuses to comply with a subpoena on the grounds that the information is injurious to national security, the Tribune General may petition the **Special Committee of the Supreme Court** to review the matter.
    (a) The executive branch shall produce the information in question directly and exclusively to the Special Committee for an *in camera* (private) review.
    (b) The Special Committee shall have the authority to determine whether the claim of national security is legitimate.
    (c) If the Committee finds the claim is legitimate, the information shall not be released. If the Committee finds the claim is not legitimate and is being used to conceal wrongdoing, it shall issue a binding order compelling the production of the information directly to the Office of the Public Tribune.

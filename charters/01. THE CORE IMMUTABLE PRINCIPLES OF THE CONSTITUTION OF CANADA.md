# The Core Immutable Principles of the Constitution of Canada

---

### PREAMble

These Core Principles are the unchangeable and permanent foundation of the nation, derived from the supreme moral law of the Holy Bible. They are immutable and shall not be altered or repealed. All other laws and constitutional articles must be in conformity with them.

---

### ARTICLE 1: THE SANCTITY OF LIFE

1.  All human life is sacred, having been created in the image of God. As such, it is a divine endowment which the state has no authority to extinguish.

2.  For the purposes of this Article, a human life is recognized as beginning at the moment of conception. The protection afforded by this constitution extends to all human beings from that point forward until natural death. Accordingly, acts intended to prematurely end a human life, including euthanasia and assisted suicide, are prohibited. This principle, however, does not obligate any individual to accept unwanted medical treatment.

3.  The authority to end a life belongs to God alone. Therefore, capital punishment is irrevocably abolished. No law shall permit it, and no sentence of death shall ever be carried out. This prohibition does not extend to the necessary use of lethal force in the immediate defense of human life under the following circumstances:
    (a) By a duly authorized agent of the state, when acting against an imminent threat of death or grievous bodily harm.
    (b) By a private citizen, when defending against an unlawful and imminent threat of death or grievous bodily harm to themselves or another innocent person.

4.  **Sentencing for Capital Offenses.** To ensure justice is served and society is protected, the state shall have the power to impose a sentence of imprisonment for the full remainder of the convicted person's natural life, making them ineligible for parole.

5.  **Special Mandate for Heinous Crimes Against Children.**
    (a) **Preamble and Principle of Exceptionalism:** In remembrance of the solemn warning that it would be better for a man to be cast into the sea with a millstone about his neck than to cause a child to stumble, the state shall treat such crimes as a supreme offense against God and the nation. These acts are recognized as being exceptional in their depravity. For this reason, the sentencing for these crimes is removed from ordinary judicial discretion and is hereby fixed by this constitution.
    (b) **Mandatory Sentence:** Any person convicted of a "Heinous Crime Against a Child," as defined by law pursuant to the protocols established in Article VII of the Constitution of Government, shall be sentenced to imprisonment for the full remainder of their natural life. This sentence is mandatory, absolute, and shall not be subject to appeal for its severity, nor shall the convicted person ever be eligible for parole.
    (c) **Exception for Juvenile Offenders:** Notwithstanding clause, if a person convicted of a Heinous Crime Against a Child is themselves below the age of eighteen at the time of the offense, the mandatory sentence shall be imprisonment with a mandatory minimum period of parole ineligibility of twenty-five years.
    (d) **Clarification on Redemption and Societal Justice:** The immutable sentences prescribed in this Article do not constitute a theological judgment on the possibility of an individual's spiritual repentance, which is a matter between that person and God. They constitute a legal and societal judgment that the commission of such a heinous act represents an absolute forfeiture of the right to live in free society, and that the protection of the innocent and the demands of retributive justice require the offender's permanent removal from it.
    (e) **Exceptions.** The exceptions for **Proof of Innocence** and **Executive Clemency** as defined below shall apply to all sentences imposed under this Article.
        (i) **Proof of Innocence:** If evidence emerges that conclusively proves the factual innocence of the person, the conviction and sentence shall be nullified, and they shall be immediately released.
        (ii) **Executive Clemency:** In extraordinary and rare circumstances not related to rehabilitation, the Head of State may grant a single commutation of sentence to a lesser penalty, but only upon the recommendation of a three-quarters supermajority of the full Supreme Court.

---

### ARTICLE 2: THE DIVINE FOUNDATION AND THE FREEDOM OF CONSCIENCE

1.  **Divine Sovereignty and National Consecration.** The sovereignty of the nation of Canada is derived from the supreme authority of the Lord God, as revealed in the Holy Bible. The nation is hereby consecrated to Him, and its public life, ceremonies, and official observances shall be conducted in a manner that gives honor to this consecration.

2.  **The Authority of Scripture.** The Holy Bible, comprising the sixty-six books of the Protestant Canon, is recognized as the ultimate and infallible source of the nation's guiding moral law. All other laws, constitutional articles, and judicial interpretations shall be subordinate to and judged by their conformity with its principles.

3.  **The Grant of Conscience.** In accordance with the Christian principle of God-given freewill, every individual is granted the freedom of conscience. This sacred freedom is the right to hold, to declare, and to peacefully manifest personal beliefs concerning God. It includes the right to worship, whether publicly or privately, alone or in community with others.

4.  **The Limits of Conscience and Religion.** The freedom of conscience is not a license for rebellion against the divine order upon which the nation is founded. Therefore, this freedom shall not be construed to:
    (a) Grant immunity from the law or justify any act that violates the Core Immutable Principles of this constitution.
    (b) Compel the state to remove, alter, or cease the public acknowledgments of its Christian foundation as required by Clause 1 of this Article.
    (c) Protect any religious practice or creed that is itself an incitement to violence, a rejection of the sanctity of life as defined in Article 1, or a violation of the moral laws established in this Charter.

5.  **Status of Other Beliefs.** A person may change their religion or hold no religion. However, while the state shall not punish a person for their private belief or unbelief, its sole constitutional duty is to uphold and protect the Christian foundation of the nation. The state is under no obligation to grant special recognition, accommodation, or privilege to any other creed or belief system.

### ARTICLE 3: THE NATURE OF THE FAMILY AND MARRIAGE

1.  The family, as founded upon the covenant of Marriage, is recognized as a natural and fundamental group unit of society, ordained by God as an essential foundation for a healthy and stable nation. The state has a solemn duty to recognize and protect its unique and vital status.

2.  Marriage is hereby defined as a sacred covenant of lifelong commitment exclusively between **one man and one woman, as these sexes are biologically defined**.

3.  **The Standard for Dissolution:** While the marriage covenant is instituted for life, the Legislature is empowered to enact laws providing for its civil dissolution. This power is not plenary and shall be strictly limited by the following principles:
    (a) **Exclusive Grounds:** A law may only grant a petition for divorce on grounds that fall within one of the following, and only the following, enumerated categories:
        (i) **Marital Unfaithfulness:** Defined as the commission of adultery by one spouse against the other.
        (ii) **Willful Desertion:** This shall be defined as either:
            *   **Physical Desertion:** The deliberate and unjustified abandonment of the marital home by one spouse for a period defined by law, with the manifest intent to end the marital union.
            *   **Constructive Desertion:** A pattern of conduct by one spouse demonstrating such profound and unrepentant cruelty, abuse, or depravity that it constitutes an abandonment of their sacred duty to love, honor, and protect. Such conduct fundamentally destroys the marital bond and renders continued cohabitation either physically unsafe or morally intolerable for the innocent spouse, regardless of whether they have been able to physically depart the marital home.
    (b) **Burden of Proof:** The burden of proving the existence of these grounds shall, in all cases, rest upon the spouse petitioning for the dissolution.

4.  **The Mandate for Legislative Gravity:** Any law governing the dissolution of marriage must incorporate procedures that reflect the gravity of the act. This shall include, at minimum, mandatory waiting periods and may include provisions for state-encouraged, but not state-compelled, reconciliation counseling. The creation of "no-fault" divorce, where dissolution is granted based on mutual consent or a declaration of irreconcilable differences, is forever prohibited.

5.  Parents are endowed with the primary right and solemn duty to direct the upbringing, education, and moral instruction of their children. The state's authority to intervene in the family is strictly limited and may only be exercised under the following conditions:
    (a) **Physical Harm:** In cases of physical abuse, abandonment, or neglect that create a direct and imminent threat to a child's physical health or their Right to Life as protected under Article 1.
    (b) **Profound Educational Neglect:** In cases where there is a demonstrable failure to provide a child with a foundational education in literacy and numeracy. The state's power in this regard is limited to ensuring these foundational skills are acquired and does not extend to dictating curriculum content.

6.  In accordance with the principle that each person is created male or female in the image of God, and to uphold the integrity of Marriage as a covenant between one man and one woman, the state, its agents, and all medical institutions are irrevocably prohibited from **performing, prescribing, or directly administering** any of the following procedures on any person, regardless of age:
    (a) Surgical procedures intended to alter primary or secondary sex characteristics to imitate the opposite sex.
    (b) The administration of hormones, including puberty-blocking agents or cross-sex hormones, with the intent or effect of arresting natural pubertal development or inducing the characteristics of the opposite sex.

7.  Any person who performs a procedure proscribed by this Article shall be subject to severe criminal penalties, which must include, as a mandatory minimum, the permanent revocation of any state-issued professional license. For greater clarity, these prohibitions do not apply to medically necessary procedures performed to treat a **verifiable physical DSD (Disorder of Sex Development)**, such as ambiguous genitalia, where the defect is documented by chromosomal analysis and physical examination. This exception shall not be construed to include any diagnosis that is primarily psychological or psychiatric in nature.

8.  For greater clarity, the prohibitions in this Article are limited to direct medical and surgical acts. They shall not be construed to infringe upon the freedom of speech as established in **Article 4**, including the right of any person to engage in academic instruction, therapeutic counseling, or public debate concerning the topics of sex and gender.

9.  The legislature may provide for secular legal contracts to address matters of property and inheritance for households not founded upon the covenant of Marriage.

10. **Authority for Preferential Status.** To promote and protect the unique status of the family as founded upon the covenant of Marriage, the Legislature is empowered to grant specific and preferential legal and fiscal status exclusively to this institution.
    (a) **Permissible Actions:** This authority is strictly limited to the granting of **positive benefits**, including but not limited to tax deductions, credits, or exemptions; preferential treatment in public benefits programs; and unique rights of inheritance and medical survivorship.
    (b) **Prohibited Actions:** For greater clarity, this authority shall not be construed to permit the imposition of any direct tax, fee, or legal penalty on any person or household based on their marital status. Furthermore, this authority may not be used to alter or abridge any fundamental judicial principle, including the requirement that child custody decisions be based solely on the best interest of the individual child.
    (c) **Supremacy over Other Articles:** The lawful exercise of this specific authority, as defined and limited herein, shall not constitute a violation of the principles of equality established in Article 11, nor shall it be deemed an infringement of the freedom of religion under Article 2.

---

### ARTICLE 4: FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND TRUTHFUL EXPRESSION

1.  Recognizing that God has endowed humanity with reason and conscience, freedom of expression is hereby established as a fundamental right. This right is an essential pillar for accountable government, the exercise of religious conscience, the pursuit of knowledge, and the flourishing of a just and open society.

2.  The freedom of expression is not absolute. The following forms of expression receive no constitutional protection:
    (a) **Defamation:** The act of knowingly making a public, false statement of fact that causes material harm to the reputation of another person. Truth shall be an absolute defense against any charge of defamation. For speech concerning public officials or matters of public concern, the person bringing the charge must also prove that the statement was made with malicious intent.
    (b) **Bearing False Witness:** Knowingly providing false testimony in judicial or official proceedings.
    (c) **Obscenity:** The commercial production or distribution of hard-core pornography, which is defined as explicit pictorial or textual depictions of sexual acts that, when taken as a whole, appeal to a prurient interest and lack serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.
    (d) **Public Desecration:** The act of intentionally and publicly desecrating a recognized place of worship (such as a church, synagogue, or mosque) or its sacred objects. This includes disrupting a formal religious service with the clear intent to mock and show contempt for the faith of the worshippers.
    (e) **Direct Incitement to Violence:** Speech which directly and intentionally advocates for immediate violence against a person or group, in violation of Article 1.

3.  To ensure government accountability, robust and honest public debate concerning political matters is protected. A person may not be punished for expressing criticism of the government, its policies, its institutions, or its officials, provided such expression does not constitute a direct incitement to violence as defined in Clause 2(e).

---

### ARTICLE 5: SECURITY FROM UNREASONABLE STATE INTRUSION

Recognizing that the home, private affairs, and conscience of a citizen are sacred domains into which the state may not arbitrarily intrude, the following rights are hereby established as immutable.

1.  **The Right to Security:** The right of the people to be secure in their persons, homes, papers, effects, and in the content of their digital communications and data against unreasonable state intrusion shall not be violated.

2.  **The Mandate for a Warrant:** A warrant, issued by a neutral judge, is the mandatory prerequisite for any search or seizure conducted by agents of the state. Any state action not founded upon such a warrant is presumptively unreasonable.

3.  **Standards for a Warrant:** No warrant shall issue, but upon:
    (a) **Probable Cause,** established by a substantial and credible showing of facts that a specific crime has been committed and that specific evidence of that crime will be found in the place to be searched.
    (b) **A sworn Oath or Affirmation,** holding the affiant personally accountable for the truthfulness of their statements.
    (c) **Particularity.** General warrants are forever prohibited. The warrant must describe with precision the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized, and the search shall not extend beyond these specified bounds.

4.  **The Exclusionary Rule:** Evidence obtained in violation of this Article is "fruit of the poisonous tree." Such evidence, and any knowledge derived directly from it, is inadmissible in any legal proceeding, for any purpose. This prohibition is absolute and shall not be subject to any "good faith" exception. It is established as a necessary deterrent to state misconduct and as a defense of the integrity of the law itself.

5.  **Exceptions to the Warrant Requirement:** A warrantless search or seizure is permissible only under the following, and only the following, exigent circumstances. In any such case, the burden of proof rests entirely upon the state to demonstrate that the circumstance was genuine and not created by its own agents.
    (a) **Consent:** A search conducted pursuant to consent that is demonstrably voluntary and uncoerced. To be considered valid, consent to search a home or person must be affirmed by the citizen, **in writing or on an audio-visual recording**, after they have been explicitly informed of their absolute right to refuse.
    (b) **Exigent Circumstances:** When an officer has probable cause to believe that a delay to obtain a warrant would result in **imminent and grave bodily harm or death** to any person. A belief that evidence may be destroyed is insufficient grounds for this exception.
    (c) **Search Incident to a Lawful Arrest:** Upon a lawful arrest, an officer may search the arrested person's body and the area within their immediate reach for the sole purpose of discovering weapons that pose a threat to the officer or the public. This exception does not extend to a search of the contents of any electronic device. A separate warrant is required to search digital data.
    (d) The Plain View Doctrine is not an exception to the requirement to obtain a warrant to enter a protected space, but clarifies that an officer who is already lawfully present in a location may seize contraband or evidence that is in plain sight without a separate warrant for the seizure itself.

6.  **Clarifications on Scope and Application:** The protections of this Article are established in the context of criminal investigation. They shall not be construed to prohibit the following legitimate, non-criminal state functions:
    (a) **International Border Security:** The state may conduct routine, warrantless searches of persons and goods **only at the physical international borders of the nation.** At such locations, any search that is more than minimally intrusive, including but not limited to body searches or any search that accesses the content of an electronic device, requires a warrant issued upon a showing of probable cause, which may be obtained from a duty judge by telephonic or other remote means. Any evidence of a crime discovered during a border search shall be inadmissible if it is shown that the search was used as a pretext for a domestic criminal investigation.
    (b) **Administrative and Safety Inspections:** The legislature may authorize programs for legitimate, non-criminal administrative inspections of commercial premises or licensed activities to ensure public health and safety. Furthermore, fixed checkpoints on public thoroughfares may be established for the limited and specific purpose of agricultural quarantine or vehicle safety inspection, provided they meet the following strict criteria: (i) the location and time are pre-authorized by a supervising authority, not by the officers in the field; (ii) they are applied to all persons in a non-discretionary, sequential pattern, such as every person or every fifth person; and (iii) the intrusion is minimal and limited to the stated purpose.
    (c) **The Burden of Proof for Pretext:** In any case where a citizen alleges that an administrative inspection or checkpoint was used as a pretext for a criminal search, the burden of proof shall rest upon the state. **Pretext shall be presumed if a criminal investigation into the person or premises was active prior to the administrative inspection.** The state can only overcome this presumption by a clear and convincing showing that the administrative inspection was independently initiated and scheduled without influence from criminal investigators.

7.  **Prohibition Against the Quartering of Soldiers.**
    (a) **Peace:** In time of peace, no soldier shall be quartered in any house without the explicit and uncoerced consent of the owner.
    (b) **War:** The quartering of soldiers in a time of war is prohibited, except under the following, and only the following, exhaustive conditions:
        (i) **Triggering Event:** The Legislature must have first issued a formal Declaration of War in response to **a sustained, armed invasion of the nation's continental territory by the formal military forces of another sovereign power.** This clause may not be invoked in response to acts of terrorism, civil unrest, or undeclared border skirmishes.
        (ii) **Legislative Act:** The Legislature must then pass a "Wartime Quartering Act," approved by a three-quarters supermajority vote in both houses. This Act must be **specific in its scope, designating the specific geographic regions or provinces where it applies** and may not grant a blanket, nationwide authority.
        (iii) **Duration:** This Act shall automatically expire 12 months after its passage. It may be renewed for subsequent 6-month periods only by another three-quarters supermajority vote.
        (iv) **Compensation Protocol:** Any Wartime Quartering Act must contain a **"Just Compensation Protocol."** This protocol shall establish a special post-conflict tribunal to assess claims. The standard for compensation shall be **the fair market replacement value of the property, as assessed on the day prior to the formal Declaration of War.** Compensation is a binding entitlement and shall be paid within one year of the conflict's conclusion. The failure to pay compensation in a timely manner after the conflict does not render the original quartering unconstitutional, but instead creates a sovereign debt owed to the citizen, bearing interest at a rate fixed by law.

### ARTICLE 6: RIGHTS OF THE ACCUSED AND FAIRNESS IN JUSTICE

---

#### Section 1: The Right to a Grand Jury

1.  **The Citizen's Shield:** No person shall be charged by the state with any crime carrying a potential sentence of imprisonment exceeding one year, unless on a formal indictment returned by a Grand Jury convened under the authority of this constitution.

2.  **The National Citizen Juror Pool:** A permanent, national pool of citizens eligible for Grand Jury service shall be maintained. Citizens shall be selected by national lottery for a three-year term of eligibility and may be called for service at any time during that term.

3.  **Convening of Grand Juries:**
    (a) Grand Juries shall be convened as needed within each province to hear cases arising from that jurisdiction.
    (b) A panel of twenty-three citizens shall be drawn by lottery from the National Pool to serve on a specific Grand Jury. To ensure impartiality, no more than one-third of any panel may be residents of the province in which the Grand Jury is convened.
    (c) The term of service for a convened Grand Jury shall be for a limited duration, not to exceed three months. Jurors shall be compensated and provided with security during their term of service.

4.  **Powers and Initiation of Review:**
    (a) A matter may be brought before a Grand Jury for review only upon the formal application of a public prosecutor.
    (b) The Grand Jury's sole duty is to determine whether probable cause exists to justify a public trial. It may not initiate its own investigations.
    (c) To ensure competent review of complex matters, a Grand Jury is empowered to retain and consult with **independent, non-governmental experts**, including but not limited to forensic accountants, engineers, and medical professionals. The cost of these experts shall be borne by the state through a dedicated, non-partisan fund overseen by the judiciary.

5.  **Finality of Decision:** The decision of the Grand Jury is final. If it returns a "no-bill" on a matter, **neither a prosecutor nor the Citizen's Tribune** may bring the same charge for the same alleged act before another Grand Jury, unless substantial new evidence, not available during the initial proceeding, is first certified as such by a judge of the provincial Court of Appeal.

6.  **Quorum and Procedural Rules:**
    (a) A Grand Jury may hear evidence and deliberate with no fewer than sixteen members present. However, a final vote to return an indictment requires the presence of the full panel of twenty-three jurors and the affirmative vote of at least **sixteen** of them.
    (b) The National Legislature shall pass a "Grand Jury Procedures Act" to establish all further operational rules, including the mechanisms for enforcing subpoenas and the standards for juror security and compensation.

---

#### Section 2: The Prohibition Against Double Jeopardy

1.  **Finality of Judgment:** When a person has been subjected to a trial for a criminal offense and a final verdict has been rendered, that person is forever barred from being prosecuted again for the same offense by **any level of government within the nation, whether municipal, provincial, or federal.**

2.  **Definition of "Same Offense":** For the purpose of this Article, "same offense" includes not only the specific crime charged but also any lesser offense necessarily included within it, and any greater offense that could have been charged based on the same criminal act or transaction.

3.  **Exceptions:** The prohibition against double jeopardy shall not apply under the following, and only the following, circumstances:
    (a) **Appeal by the Accused:** If a convicted person successfully appeals their conviction and it is overturned on procedural grounds, the state may conduct one new trial.
    (b) **Manifest Necessity:** If a trial is terminated before a final verdict due to a catastrophic and irremediable defect not caused by prosecutorial misconduct.
    (c) **Fraud Upon the Court:** If conclusive evidence emerges, after an acquittal, that the verdict was procured by the accused through bribery of a judge, juror, or material officer of the court, the Supreme Court may authorize a single new trial.

---

#### Section 3: The Right Against Compelled Self-Incrimination

1.  **Burden of Proof:** In all criminal matters, the burden of proof rests entirely upon the state.

2.  **The Right to Silence of the Individual:** An individual human being cannot be compelled in any criminal case to provide testimony against themselves.
    (a) An accused person cannot be compelled to take the witness stand at their own trial.
    (b) The exercise of this right to silence, at any stage of an investigation or trial, shall not be used in any way to impeach the credibility of the accused, nor shall any adverse inference be drawn from it.

3.  **Immunity and Compelled Testimony:** The legislature may enact laws permitting a prosecutor, with judicial approval, to grant a person "use and derivative use immunity." This is a binding promise that the compelled testimony, and any evidence derived directly from it, will not be used to prosecute that individual. Upon receiving such a grant of immunity, the person may be compelled to testify. A refusal to testify after a grant of immunity may be subject to penalty.

4.  **Scope of the Right:** This right protects a natural person from being compelled to provide self-incriminating testimony. It does not extend to:
    (a) The compelled provision of physical, non-testimonial evidence such as fingerprints or DNA samples.
    (b) **Artificial Entities.** Corporations, associations, or other collective entities may not claim this right. They can be compelled to produce documents and records. An individual custodian of records cannot refuse to produce them by claiming the act of production would incriminate the entity.

---

#### Section 4: Guarantees of a Fair Trial

In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the following, non-negotiable rights:
1.  **The Right to a Speedy and Public Trial:** To prevent indefinite detention and secret proceedings, every trial must commence within a reasonable time and be open to the public and press.

2.  **The Right to an Impartial Jury:** To be judged by one's fellow citizens, not by the state, the accused has the right to a trial by an impartial jury of their peers, drawn from the province and district wherein the crime was committed.

3.  **The Right to be Informed:** To prepare a defense, the accused must be informed, in detail and in advance of the trial, of the specific nature and cause of every accusation against them.

4.  **The Right of Confrontation:** To face one's accusers, the accused has the right to be confronted with the witnesses against them, to hear their testimony in open court, and to subject them to cross-examination.

5.  **The Right to Compulsory Process:** To present a defense, the accused has the right to the court's power to compel the attendance of witnesses in their favor.

6.  **The Right to Counsel:** To ensure a competent defense, the accused has the right to the assistance of legal counsel. If the accused cannot afford counsel, counsel must be provided by the state. This right to counsel is absolute and applies at every critical stage of the criminal process, from the point of arrest onward.

---

#### Section 5: Prohibition on Financial Coercion

1.  Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed.

2.  The purpose of bail is solely to ensure the appearance of the accused at trial. The amount of bail must be based on the severity of the alleged offense, the evidence against the accused, and their individual risk of flight, not on the accused's ability to pay.

---

### ARTICLE 7: PROPERTY, STEWARDSHIP, AND SOUND MONEY

---

#### Section 1: The Divine Right of Property and Stewardship

1.  **Foundational Principle.** Recognizing that God is sovereign over all creation, the right of individuals and families to own and control property as stewards is hereby established as a fundamental pillar of liberty. This right is inviolable, and the principles of good stewardship are a matter of private conscience and religious duty, not a pretext for state intervention.

2.  **Scope of Property.** For all constitutional purposes, the right to property shall extend to both real property (land and chattels) and intellectual property, including patents, copyrights, and trade secrets, lawfully held by a citizen or a "Qualified Domestic Corporation."
    (a) A Qualified Domestic Corporation is hereby defined as a corporation in which a majority of the voting shares are held by citizens of the nation and which is not subject to the control or direction of a foreign state or entity.
    (b) The Legislature shall provide for the strong enforcement of these rights and create severe penalties for their theft or infringement, particularly by foreign state actors.

---

#### Section 2: The Mandate for Sound Money and a Balanced Budget

1.  **Prohibition of Deficit Spending.** The government's operational budget must be balanced. The state is prohibited from borrowing money or issuing debt to fund its annual operating expenditures. Deficit spending is permitted only for capital-intensive projects approved under the National Project Bond protocols or during a constitutionally declared State of Emergency.

2.  **Definition of Revenue.** Government revenue is classified into two distinct types:
    (a) **Tax Revenue:** All funds collected from the people through taxation.
    (b) **Stewardship Revenue:** All net income generated from the profitable management of federal assets, such as mineral rights or state-owned enterprises.

---

#### Section 3: The Constitutional Limits of Federal Taxation

1.  **The Direct Tax on Taxable Income.** The federal government may levy a direct tax on the income of individuals and corporations, subject to the following limitations:
    (a) **The Personal Income Exemption.** A portion of every individual's annual income, known as the Personal Income Exemption, shall be exempt from all federal income taxation.
    (b) **Determination of the Exemption Amount.** To prevent political manipulation, the Legislature shall, by law, fix the value of the Personal Income Exemption by pegging it to forty percent (40%) of the nation's median individual income from the previous census. This amount shall be adjusted annually for inflation.
    (c) **Taxable Income.** For any individual, "Taxable Income" is defined as their total gross income minus the Personal Income Exemption. If this calculation results in a number less than or equal to zero, their Taxable Income is zero. For corporations, all net profit is considered Taxable Income.
    (d) **Single Uniform Rate.** The federal income tax shall be levied at a **single, uniform rate** on all Taxable Income.
    (e) **Revenue Limitation.** The total revenue collected under this clause shall not, in any fiscal year, exceed ten percent (10%) of the nation's Gross Domestic Product for the previous year.

2.  **The Combined Tax Limitation.** The Legislature may authorize indirect taxes, such as national customs duties or consumption taxes. However, the total combined revenue from all forms of federal taxation (both direct and indirect) shall not, in any fiscal year, exceed **fifteen percent (15%)** of the nation's Gross Domestic Product for the previous year.

3.  **The Fiscal Responsibility Ratchet.** The authority to collect the final three percentage points of the combined tax limit (i.e., to tax between 12% and 15% of GDP) is a privilege that must be earned through fiscal prudence. This authority is conditional upon the following:
    (a) **Condition:** So long as the total national debt exceeds forty percent (40%) of the nation's Gross Domestic Product, the combined federal tax revenue from all sources shall be limited to a maximum of **twelve percent (12%)** of GDP.
    (b) **Activation:** The full fifteen percent (15%) cap shall only be available in fiscal years following a year in which the final audited national debt was below the forty percent (40%) threshold.

---

#### Section 4: The Stewardship of Public Assets

1.  **Purpose of Stewardship Revenue.** All Stewardship Revenue collected in a given year shall be used for one of two purposes only:
    (a) To make a supplemental deposit into the National Emergency Fund.
    (b) To pay down the principal of the national debt.

2.  **Prohibition on Use.** Stewardship Revenue shall not be used to fund the government's operational budget. This ensures that profits from national assets are used for long-term national security and stability, not for short-term political spending.

---

#### Section 5: The National Emergency Fund

1.  **Establishment and Purpose.** A sacred and inviolable National Emergency Fund is established to provide for the nation's survival during a constitutionally declared State of Emergency. Its assets shall be held exclusively in Canadian sovereign debt or physical gold.

2.  **Mandatory Annual Deposit.** The first allocation of Tax Revenue in each federal budget shall be a non-negotiable deposit into the National Emergency Fund. This deposit shall be equal to **five percent (5%)** of the previous year's total federal Tax Revenue.

3.  **Replenishment Protocol.** Following the end of a declared emergency during which the Fund was used, the mandatory deposit rate shall be increased to **ten percent (10%)** of federal Tax Revenue. This accelerated rate shall continue until the Fund's balance is fully restored to its pre-emergency level, adjusted for inflation.

---

#### Section 6: Protocol for Suspending Fiscal Limitations in a National Emergency

1.  The fiscal limitations in this Article are absolute, except when suspended by the declaration of a State of Emergency. This may only be done by adhering to one of the following two exhaustive protocols:
    (a) **In the Event of War or Sudden Catastrophe:** Following a formal Declaration of War or in response to a sudden, catastrophic physical event, the legislature may declare a State of Emergency by a **three-quarters supermajority vote** in both legislative houses.
    (b) **In the Event of a Protracted Existential Crisis:** To address a developing crisis that threatens the collapse of the national economy or mass casualties, the legislature may, by a two-thirds supermajority vote, pass an "Act of Petition" for a national referendum. A State of Emergency is declared only if this petition is approved by a **three-fifths (60%) majority of the national electorate.**

2.  **Duration and Renewal.** Any State of Emergency declared under these protocols shall automatically expire after **24 months**. Renewal requires the entire declaration process to be initiated again from the beginning.

---

### ARTICLE 8: PRIVATE CHARITY AND NATIONAL BENEVOLENCE

1.  **Recognition and Protection:** The state recognizes that the primary duty and most effective means of caring for the poor, the widow, and the orphan resides with religious institutions and private citizens. The legislature is prohibited from enacting any law whose primary purpose or principal effect is to impede, usurp, or supplant the core charitable mission of a Qualified Charitable Organization.

2.  **Submission to Law:** This protection shall not be construed to create immunity from the law. All such organizations are subject to neutral, generally applicable laws, including but not limited to:
    (a) Criminal statutes concerning fraud, theft, and bodily harm.
    (b) Health, safety, and zoning ordinances essential for public welfare.
    (c) Laws governing contracts, property ownership, and employment.

3.  **Tax Exemption and Deduction:** All donations to a Qualified Charitable Organization shall be exempt from taxation. A taxpayer may claim a deduction for such donations, but the total annual deduction shall not exceed fifty percent (50%) of the taxpayer's gross income, calculated before the application of this deduction.

4.  **Definition of a Qualified Charitable Organization (QCO):** To be designated a QCO and receive the protections and benefits of this Article, an institution must meet, and annually verify, the following non-negotiable criteria:
    (a) **The Public Benefit Mandate:** The organization's *exclusive* purpose and activity must be public benevolence. It is explicitly prohibited from acting as a political action committee, endorsing candidates for public office, or engaging in for-profit commercial activity not directly related to its mission.
    (b) **The Fiduciary Integrity Clause:** The organization must be governed by a Board of Directors of no fewer than five individuals. To ensure independence:
        (i) No more than one-third of the board members may be related by blood or marriage to any other board member or to the organization's senior executives.
        (ii) No board member, nor any company they hold a major interest in, may engage in a financial transaction with the organization from which they derive personal profit.
    (c) **The Efficiency and Transparency Standard:** The organization must demonstrate superlative stewardship by:
        (i) Submitting to an annual, independent financial audit, the complete text of which must be published in a publicly accessible digital format.
        (ii) Directing a minimum of eighty percent (80%) of its total annual expenditures to Direct Program Services, defined as the goods, services, and funds delivered directly to the intended beneficiaries.
        (iii) Limiting total annual expenditures on combined administrative overhead and fundraising to a maximum of twenty percent (20%). Salaries for executive officers shall be classified as administrative overhead.
    **(d) The Empowerment Standard:** In evaluating its purpose, preference shall be given to organizations whose charitable model emphasizes empowering individuals to achieve self-reliance with dignity over models that foster long-term dependency.**

### ARTICLE 9: THE RIGHT OF THE PEOPLE TO KEEP AND BEAR ARMS

1.  The right of the people to keep and bear arms, as a necessary means of defending their life, family, and liberty against both criminal and tyrannical threats, shall not be infringed.

2.  To ensure a state of readiness for the common defense and to provide a disciplined body capable of rendering aid during catastrophic civil emergencies, and without diminishing the primary right of individual self-defense as secured in Clause 1, this Charter establishes a well-regulated militia as the prescribed constitutional means for the common defense.

3.  For the purpose of this Article, "the people" shall be understood to include all adult citizens not otherwise disqualified by this constitution. The legislature is empowered to pass laws prohibiting the possession of arms by the following classes of individuals only:
    (a) **Convicted Felons,** specifically those convicted of violent crimes or crimes of a treasonous nature.
    (b) **The Mentally Infirm,** specifically those who have been formally and legally adjudicated by a court of law as a danger to themselves or others.
    (c) **Non-citizens** of the nation.
    (d) **Individuals Under Pre-Trial Restriction,** specifically a person currently released on bail or pre-trial supervision for a credible charge of a violent felony. This prohibition is temporary and lasts only for the duration of the pre-trial period, and the initial finding of a "credible charge" must be made by a judge during a formal bail hearing.

4.  The right to keep and bear arms is absolute regarding the type and quantity of arms an individual may possess. The state shall make no law restricting the ownership of any category of conventional arms, including but not limited to semi-automatic or fully automatic firearms, suppressors, body armor, and conventional explosives.

5.  This absolute right does not extend to arms whose nature is to cause death or grievous bodily harm in an indiscriminate manner over a wide area, without the possibility of being aimed at a specific threat. The development or possession of any such device by private citizens is prohibited.

6.  To prevent the erosion of this right through indirect means, the state is hereby prohibited from:
    (a) Establishing any registry of firearms or their owners.
    (b) Implementing any law that has the effect of confiscating legally owned arms.
    (c) Requiring any form of compulsory buy-back program.

7.  The state's power to regulate the exercise of this right is strictly limited to the following:
    (a) **Background Checks:** The state may require instant background checks at the point of sale to verify that a potential buyer is not a member of a disqualified class as defined in Clause 3.
    (b) **Sensitive Places:** The legislature may prohibit the carrying of arms into highly sensitive areas where security is paramount, specifically: legislative chambers, courtrooms, and secure military installations.
    (c) **Private Property Rights:** Private property owners retain the right to prohibit or permit the carrying of arms on their own premises.

8.  **Interoperability Mandate:** To ensure the continued viability of the militia as a check on tyrannical power, the state is prohibited from adopting any standard-issue personal arm for the **Regulated Militias** unless that arm, or its functional equivalent, is available for lawful acquisition by the general citizenry. The principle of interoperability between the arms of the citizen and the arms of the citizen-soldier shall not be infringed.

### ARTICLE 10: THE OFFICE OF THE PUBLIC TRIBUNE

1.  **Mandate and Purpose**
    (a) To serve as the people's permanent and independent watchdog, there is hereby established the Office of the Public Tribune. Its sole mandate is to guard the public trust by investigating and exposing corruption, gross mismanagement, and waste within the government.
    (b) For the purposes of this Article, "corruption" is defined as the use of public office for private or partisan gain; "gross mismanagement" is defined as a severe and persistent pattern of negligence leading to measurable public harm, not merely a policy disagreement; and "waste" is defined as expenditure with no discernible rational connection to a stated public benefit.
    (c) The Tribune is an instrument of public accountability, not a branch of government; it shall possess no executive, legislative, or judicial authority to rule, veto, or command, but shall be endowed with the specific powers enumerated herein to ensure its findings are brought into the public light and answered.

2.  **Structure and Composition**
    (a) **The Tribune's Office:** A permanent, non-partisan agency directed by the **Tribune General**. The Office shall be staffed by professional experts. The Tribune General shall be appointed for a single, non-renewable term of ten years.
    (b) **The National Citizen Jury:** A rotating body of 151 citizens selected by national lottery for a single, non-renewable two-year term. Members shall be compensated and have their employment protected by law. Any attempt to bribe, threaten, or unduly influence a member of the Jury shall be a high crime with severe mandatory penalties.

3.  **Powers of Investigation, Censure, and Response**
    (a) **Investigative Authority:** The Tribune's Office may conduct audits and investigations. While preliminary inquiries may be initiated at its discretion, a full-scale public investigation must be authorized by the Tribune General under a **Major Investigation Protocol**, which requires confidential notification to a special committee of the Supreme Court outlining the basis for the investigation.
    (b) **Referral and Rebuttal:** If an investigation uncovers credible evidence of criminal conduct, the Tribune shall transmit the case file to the appropriate Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP).
        (i) The DPP must, within 120 days, publicly declare their intent to either prosecute or not.
        (ii) Should the DPP decline to prosecute, the Tribune General is empowered to issue a **Public Rebuttal**, a non-binding report detailing the strength of the evidence to the public.
    (c) **Power of Public Censure:** The National Citizen Jury shall convene public hearings on the final reports of the Tribune's Office. Following these hearings, the Jury may, by a two-thirds majority vote, issue a formal **Public Censure** against a government department or official.
    (d) **Juror Shielding Protocol:** The Tribune's Office is empowered to sequester or otherwise protect the identity and safety of Jurors during sensitive proceedings to ensure their impartiality.
    (e) **The Mandatory Public Response and Accountability Scorecard:** A Public Censure constitutionally compels the Legislature to hold a public debate and publish a formal report responding to each of the Tribune's recommendations. One year after this response, the Tribune's Office shall publish an **"Accountability Scorecard,"** grading the government's implementation of the agreed-upon reforms.
    (f) **Clarification of Powers:** The Tribune's power of subpoena applies to testimony and to documents related to the conduct of public business held by government agencies or private entities contracted by the state. This power shall not be construed to authorize the physical search of a private citizen's home or personal effects, which remains subject to the warrant requirements of Article 5. The Tribune's Office may seek such a warrant through the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions when necessary for an investigation.

4.  **Role in Judicial Review**
    The Tribune's Office shall produce a public **"Report on Judicial Fitness"** for all judicial nominees, providing an impartial assessment of their qualifications. This report is advisory to the confirming authority.

5.  **Accountability of the Tribune**
    (a) **Mid-Term Review:** At the five-year mark of their term, the Tribune General shall be subject to a **Judicial Review of Fitness** by a panel of senior judges, who shall issue a public finding of "Confidence" or "No Confidence."
    (b) **Removal from Office:** The Tribune General may be removed from office for defined gross misconduct or dereliction of duty. This can only be initiated if the Legislature, by a two-thirds supermajority vote, authorizes a national referendum on the question, which must then be approved by a majority of the electorate.

### ARTICLE 11: EQUALITY OF RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITY

1.  To reflect the equal dignity of all persons created in the image of God, every citizen is equal before and under the law. Equality of rights shall be absolute. **The state shall not, in any of its laws or actions, grant any advantage or impose any disadvantage based on race, sex, ethnic origin, or any other form of collective group identity.**

2.  **The doctrine of "separate but equal" is a constitutional falsehood and is forever prohibited. No citizen shall be compelled to use a separate facility or be denied access to any public accommodation, service, or institution based on their race or ethnic origin.**

3.  Every citizen possesses the absolute right to enter, remain in, and leave Canada.

4.  Every citizen has the right to move to and take up residence in any province, and to pursue the gaining of a livelihood therein, subject to the neutral and generally applicable laws of that province.

5.  This equality extends to all civil and political rights, duties, and privileges, including but not limited to the right to own and inherit property, to form contracts, to receive an education, to pursue a trade or profession, and to vote and hold public office.

6.  The purpose of this Article is to guarantee **equality of individual opportunity**, not to engineer **equality of statistical outcomes between groups**. A law shall be deemed non-discriminatory if it applies to all individuals equally, regardless of their sex. A statistical imbalance in any profession, institution, or area of life shall not, in itself, be considered proof of a violation of this Article.

7.  For greater clarity, this Article shall not be construed in a manner that abrogates, diminishes, or reinterprets the principles, definitions, and distinctions established in **Article 3** of this Charter concerning the nature of Marriage and the family.

### ARTICLE 12: NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY

1.  Canada is a sovereign and independent nation. The ultimate authority for all governance resides exclusively with the people of Canada through this Charter and the Constitution of Government. No law or directive originating from a foreign power, international body, private foundation, or non-governmental organization shall have legal force within the nation, unless it is explicitly and lawfully adopted through the nation's own legislative process.

2.  International treaties are instruments of national policy and are subordinate to this Charter. Should a conflict arise between a treaty and the Charter, the Charter shall prevail. However, for the purpose of maintaining international trust and order, any provision of a ratified treaty that is found by the Supreme Court to conflict with the **amendable Constitution of Government** shall not be immediately voided. Instead, the government shall be constitutionally obligated to either: (a) formally withdraw from the conflicting provision of the treaty, or (b) initiate the process to amend the Constitution of Government to resolve the conflict.

3.  To preserve political integrity, the Legislature shall pass, and the executive shall enforce, laws prohibiting any foreign entity or non-citizen from directly or indirectly funding, directing, or influencing domestic political outcomes. These laws shall specifically include prohibitions on:
    (a) Contributions to political candidates, parties, referendums, or political action committees.
    (b) The channeling of funds through domestic non-profit or charitable organizations for the purpose of undertaking partisan political advocacy or issue-based campaigns intended to influence an election or legislation. A charitable organization's funding shall be presumed to be for a prohibited purpose if more than ten percent of its total annual budget originates from foreign sources.

---

### PREAMBLE

We, the people of Canada, acknowledging the Lord God as the supreme authority over all creation and affirming the Holy Bible as the ultimate source of all moral law, do hereby humbly consecrate this nation to Him. We petition the Lord God to accept this, our National Covenant, as our solemn and binding promise to live as a people under His authority and in accordance with His law.

In this act, we seek His divine blessing, His guidance for our leaders, His protection over our land, and His grace upon our people. We dedicate ourselves and our posterity to upholding the virtues and fulfilling the duties contained herein, so that we may be a nation that is pleasing to Him.

Therefore, this Covenant shall serve as our permanent national aspiration and the moral compass by which our laws are framed and our public life is conducted, offered in faith and hope.

### DECLARATION OF CONSTITUTIONAL PURPOSE

This National Covenant complements the **Core Immutable Principles** and the **Constitution of Government**. It is a declaration of the enduring virtues and societal aspirations that shall guide the character of the nation and its people.

The principles contained herein are not intended to create criminal offenses or civil liabilities for which a citizen may be punished by the state. Instead, they shall serve as a mandatory and binding guide for the Legislature in the framing of all laws, for the Judiciary in their interpretation of all laws, and for the People in the conduct of their public and private lives. They are the solemn bond that unites the nation in a common moral purpose.

### ARTICLE I: CANONS OF INTERPRETATION

To ensure the virtues of this Covenant are applied with consistency and wisdom, all who are bound by it shall adhere to the following canons of interpretation:

1.  **The Principle of Harmony:** No virtue shall be interpreted in isolation in a way that nullifies another. The virtues of Justice and Mercy, of Diligence and Charity, and of Responsibility and Grace must be held in creative tension and harmonized. Where they appear to conflict, the interpretation that best balances the competing virtues shall be preferred.

2.  **The Principle of Deference:** In all matters of interpretation, the highest deference shall be granted to the integrity of the family and the sanctity of the individual conscience as established in the **Core Immutable Principles**. The virtues of the community shall not be construed in a manner that usurps the primary role of the parent or compels the conscience of the citizen in matters not essential to public order or the protection of life.

3.  **The Principle of Life's Preservation:** When interpreting any virtue in a context where human life is at stake, the interpretation that most favors the preservation of innocent life, from its beginning to its natural end, shall always prevail.

### ARTICLE II: THE VIRTUE OF THE INDIVIDUAL

1.  **Walking Circumspectly:** A citizen is called to **walk circumspectly, not as a fool, but as wise**, recognizing that the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. The pursuit of wisdom is held as a higher virtue than the attainment of riches or power.

2.  **Honesty and Integrity:** A citizen's word is their bond. They are called to live in **goodness, righteousness, and truth**, ensuring that truthfulness in speech, honesty in dealings, and integrity in character are the foundations of trust upon which a free and prosperous society is built.

3.  **Diligence and Redeeming the Time:** Honest labor is a dignified and essential aspect of human life. Every citizen is encouraged to apply themselves with diligence to their chosen vocation, thereby **redeeming the time** given to them, providing for themselves and their household, and contributing to the well-being of the nation through their work.

4.  **Guarding the Heart and Tongue:** A citizen is called to guard their heart from envy and covetousness, and to govern their tongue, knowing that **filthiness, foolish talking, and jesting are not convenient**. Let conversation be marked by grace and aimed at building others up.

5.  **Personal Responsibility:** Every citizen is called to a life of self-reliance, to be accountable for their actions, and to bear the consequences of their choices with fortitude.

6.  **Temperance and Self-Control:** The virtuous citizen strives to govern their passions, appetites, and ambitions. **Be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit**, seeking moderation and discipline in all things.

7.  **Gratitude and Thankfulness:** The virtuous citizen cultivates a spirit of gratitude, **giving thanks always for all things**. A thankful heart is the guard against the poison of envy and the foundation of a contented and generous life.

8.  **Faithful Use of Talents:** Each citizen is endowed with unique gifts, talents, and opportunities. It is a high virtue to cultivate and employ these gifts productively—not burying them through fear or sloth—but investing them for the betterment of one's household, community, and nation.

9.  **The Foundation of Wisdom and Delight in the Law:** A citizen is called to find their deepest delight in the law of the Lord, meditating upon it day and night as the wellspring of all wisdom. By anchoring their life in God's eternal instruction, they shall avoid the passing counsel of the ungodly and the seat of the scornful, and instead become like a tree planted by rivers of water, stable in purpose and fruitful in their season.

### ARTICLE III: THE SANCTITY OF THE FAMILY

1.  **Chastity and Fidelity:** The covenant of Marriage between a man and a woman is the sacred and proper sanctuary for physical union. The nation holds as a high ideal the virtue of chastity before Marriage and of absolute fidelity within it, recognizing these as pillars of stable families and the secure upbringing of children.

2.  **Honor and Reciprocal Duties:** The family is an institution of reciprocal duties founded in the fear of God. In this covenant, the wife is called to **submit herself unto her own husband, as unto the Lord.** In turn, the husband is called to **love his wife, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it.** Parents have a solemn obligation to raise their children with love, discipline, and moral instruction. Children, in turn, have a duty to honor their father and mother, and to ensure they are cared for in their old age.

3.  **Patience and Forgiveness within the Family:** Recognizing human imperfection, family members are encouraged to bear with one another in patience, to be quick to forgive offenses, and to seek reconciliation, thereby reflecting the grace upon which the nation itself hopes to stand.

---

### ARTICLE IV: THE CHARACTER OF THE COMMUNITY

1.  **The Golden Rule:** The entire life of the community shall be guided by the foundational principle of reciprocity: "Do to others as you would have them do to you." This single rule, when practiced with sincerity, is the wellspring of justice, mercy, and genuine neighborliness.

2.  **Justice and Mercy:** The community is called to do justice and love mercy. This includes applying the same standard of fairness to all, defending the cause of the weak, and ensuring that the widow, the orphan, and the stranger are not exploited but are treated with dignity and compassion.

3.  **Charity and Hospitality:** Citizens are encouraged to **walk in love**, showing active compassion and charity to the poor, the widow, the orphan, and the stranger. A spirit of generosity and hospitality toward one's neighbor is the hallmark of a good and decent community.

4.  **Reconciliation and Peacemaking:** Citizens and communities are encouraged not merely to avoid conflict, but to be active peacemakers, seeking to mediate disputes, heal divisions, and foster a spirit of genuine reconciliation.

5.  **Good Stewardship:** The right to property is a call to stewardship. All citizens and communities are encouraged to use the nation's lands and resources wisely, to avoid waste, and to preserve the beauty and fruitfulness of creation for future generations.

6.  **Civility and Mutual Submission:** In public discourse and private interaction, citizens are called to treat one another with respect, **submitting themselves one to another in the fear of God**. A healthy community is one where neighbors are quick to help and slow to anger, even in disagreement.

7.  **Forbearance and Magnanimity:** The community, recognizing that its authority is a stewardship from God, is called to exercise its power with humility and restraint. It shall not use the law to coerce matters of private conscience that do not violate the **Core Immutable Principles**. A just community fulfills its calling not by crushing dissent, but by seeking to be a worthy example of its faith, thereby serving as a light that persuades in charity and reflects the grace of God.

### ARTICLE V: THE DUTY OF THE CITIZEN

1.  **The Purpose of Just Governance:** A citizen's respect for the law is rooted in the understanding that the purpose of just government is to serve as God's instrument to restrain evil and to commend what is good. Therefore, citizens have a duty to support and hold accountable a government that faithfully fulfills this moral charge.

2.  **Patriotism and Service:** A citizen ought to cultivate a spirit of patriotism, which is a noble love for one's country, its people, and its principles. Where required, a citizen has a duty to aid in the defense of the nation and its liberties.

3.  **Respect for Just Law:** A virtuous citizen respects and upholds the rule of law, recognizing that it is a necessary shield for the liberty and safety of all.

4.  **Informed Participation:** In a self-governing nation, every citizen has a duty to be informed on matters of public importance, to participate thoughtfully in civic life, and to ensure that the government remains accountable to the people.

5.  **The Duty of Prudent Counsel:** Those citizens who are entrusted with public office are called to exercise their authority with humility. They are encouraged to seek out and heed wise and diverse counsel before making decisions of consequence, for a leader's wisdom is best demonstrated not by their own knowledge alone, but by their willingness to listen and learn.

### ARTICLE VI: THE NATIONAL PLEDGE

As a voluntary affirmation of the principles contained within this Covenant, citizens are encouraged to make this pledge in their hearts and in their communities, as a personal and public commitment to the ideals of the nation:

> Before God, the ultimate sovereign of this land,
> I will set my life to be as a tree.
> I will set my roots deep in the soil of His Word,
> that I may stand firm and not be as the chaff driven by the wind.
>
> May the fruit of my life then be **honesty** in my work,
> **faithfulness** to my family, and **charity** to my neighbor.
>
> Knowing a strong nation is a forest of such rooted lives,
> therefore, I commit my hands to its **faithful stewardship**.
>
> May we, by His grace, leave it more just, faithful, and free
> for the generation that follows.
>
> So help me God.

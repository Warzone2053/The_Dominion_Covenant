---

### PREAMBLE
This document establishes the structure, powers, and procedures of the government of Canada. It is the highest operational law of the land and is subordinate only to the Charter of Immutable Principles. All articles herein must be interpreted in a manner consistent with the Charter.

---

### ARTICLE I: AMENDMENT PROCESS

An amendment to this Constitution may only be passed with the approval of:
1.  A two-thirds supermajority vote in the national Legislature.
2.  Ratification by the legislatures of at least two-thirds (7 of 10) of the provinces.
3.  Final confirmation by a national, binding referendum in which a majority of citizens approve the change.

---

### ARTICLE II: LOCAL AND MUNICIPAL GOVERNANCE

1.  **The Principle of Subsidiarity:** To ensure that governance remains as close to the people as possible, the principle of subsidiarity is hereby established. This means that matters ought to be handled by the smallest, lowest, or least centralized competent authority. Powers shall only be granted to a higher level of government if they cannot be effectively performed at a lower level.

2.  **Charter and Powers of Municipalities:** Communities may, by a local referendum, establish a chartered Municipal government. These governments shall have the authority to manage local affairs and services, specifically: (a) local roads, water, and sanitation; (b) local policing and by-law enforcement; (c) local parks and libraries; (d) land use and zoning; (e) local emergency services.

3.  **Municipal Taxation and Finance:** The power of a Municipal government to levy taxes shall be strictly limited to property taxes and direct user fees. The property tax rate shall be set annually by a binding referendum of the citizens of the municipality. To be enacted, the proposed rate must be approved by a **three-fifths (60%) majority** of those voting. All municipal budgets must be balanced annually.

4.  **The Citizen's Initiative:**
    (a) **Initiation:** By gathering a petition signed by five percent (5%) of the local electorate, the citizens of any municipality can propose a new law or major spending project to be put to a binding public referendum.
    (b) **Public Review and Fiscal Note:** Before any such referendum is held, the municipal government shall be required to conduct and publish an impartial **"Fiscal and Legal Impact Review,"** which must be attached to the ballot information provided to all voters.
    (c) **Passage Requirement:** To be enacted, any measure proposed by a Citizen's Initiative must be approved by a **three-fifths (60%) majority** of those voting in the referendum.

5.  **Provincial Pre-eminence on Critical Infrastructure:** The provincial government may override municipal zoning to build critical infrastructure (major highways, power grids, pipelines) that serves multiple communities. To do so, it must declare the project a "Provincial Priority" and provide special compensation to the affected municipality.

6.  **Provincial Role in Fiscal Stability:** The provincial government shall have the authority to establish a minimum municipal property tax rate and to administer a Provincial Equalization Fund to ensure a baseline of essential services across all communities.

7.  **Standards for Law Enforcement:** Municipalities shall manage their own police services, but the provincial government is responsible for setting and enforcing uniform, province-wide standards for training, conduct, and rules of engagement.

8.  **Supremacy of the Charter:** No municipal action may infringe upon the rights and principles established in the Charter of Immutable Principles. The provincial courts have the jurisdiction to strike down any such action.

### ARTICLE III: PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT

**Section 1: Administration of Justice**

1.  **Provincial Judiciary and Its Structure:**
    (a) Each provincial legislature is hereby granted the authority to establish and maintain the provincial courts, which shall include trial-level courts and a provincial court of appeal. These courts shall adjudicate all matters of law within the province, subordinate only to the Supreme Court of Canada.
    (b) The power to organize the courts is strictly limited to matters of judicial administration. This includes establishing rules of procedure, managing judicial caseloads and schedules, and determining the number and location of courthouses based on publicly auditable data regarding population and caseload needs.
    (c) The creation of specialized courts or judicial divisions is permitted only for the purpose of administrative efficiency in distinct areas of law, such as family or commercial law. The creation of any court or tribunal with a mandate focused on a specific political or ideological matter is explicitly prohibited.
    (d) No courthouse or judicial service may be closed or significantly reduced for punitive reasons. Any proposal to close a courthouse must be supported by a public report demonstrating a sustained lack of caseload, and the decision must be approved by the Provincial Judicial Council.

2.  **Provincial Policing Standards and Municipal Autonomy:**
    (a) The provincial government has the duty to establish province-wide minimum standards for municipal police services to ensure public safety, professional conduct, and the protection of constitutional rights.
    (b) These standards shall be developed and maintained by a "Provincial Police Standards Commission," an independent body composed of representatives from the provincial government, municipal governments, and provincial police chiefs' associations, and chaired by a nominee appointed by the Provincial Judicial Council. The standards shall be public documents.
    (c) The scope of these standards is limited to matters of recruitment, training in core competencies, use-of-force policies, and rules of professional conduct. No standard may be used to impose a specific political or social ideology upon a municipal police service.
    (d) Enforcement of these standards shall follow a graduated and transparent process. If a municipal service is found to be non-compliant, the province must first provide a formal notice and a reasonable period for remediation.
    (e) If a dispute arises over compliance or if a municipality believes a standard is unreasonable, the municipality has the right to appeal to the Provincial Judicial Council for a binding ruling.
    (f) The province may only assume temporary administrative control of a municipal police service under extraordinary circumstances, upon a finding by the Provincial Judicial Council that the service has suffered a catastrophic failure of conduct or capability that poses a direct and imminent threat to the life and liberty of its citizens, and that the municipality has failed to remedy the situation. Any such administrative control shall be for a fixed term and subject to review by the Council.

3.  **Provincial Director of Public Prosecutions:**
    (a) Each province shall establish the office of the Provincial Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), which shall be an independent and non-partisan officer of the Legislature. The DPP shall be responsible for initiating, managing, and overseeing all criminal prosecutions within the provincial territory.
    (b) The DPP shall be appointed for a single, non-renewable ten-year term. The appointment must be approved by a two-thirds supermajority vote of the provincial legislature. The DPP can only be removed from office prior to the end of their term for gross misconduct or incapacity, following an investigation and a subsequent vote of no confidence requiring a three-quarters supermajority of the legislature.
    (c) In the exercise of their prosecutorial functions, the DPP shall not be subject to the direction or control of any person or authority. They shall have the sole authority to issue and publish binding guidelines on prosecutorial discretion to ensure fairness and consistency.
    (d) There shall be a separate office of the Provincial Attorney General, who shall be a member of the executive cabinet. The Attorney General shall act as the chief legal advisor to the government and shall be responsible for all civil litigation involving the provincial state, but shall possess no authority over criminal prosecutions.

4.  **Appointment and Confirmation of Provincial Judges:**
    (a) A permanent Provincial Judicial Council is established in each province, composed of three voting members: the acting Chief Justice of the province, the Provincial Director of Public Prosecutions, and a representative selected by the provincial Law Society.
    (b) The Council's sole mandate is to identify and evaluate candidates based on merit, defined as demonstrable legal knowledge, professional experience, and judicial temperament. Consideration of a candidate's political affiliation or expressed ideology is prohibited.
    (c) When a judicial vacancy arises, the Council shall submit a list of not less than three and not more than five highly qualified nominees to a permanent, all-party Judicial Appointments Committee of the provincial legislature. The Council shall provide the Committee with a detailed report justifying each nominee's inclusion.
    (d) This Legislative Committee shall hold public confirmation hearings for the nominees. Following these hearings, the Committee shall forward the list of all nominees it has confirmed to the provincial executive (the Premier or Cabinet).
    (e) The provincial executive shall select and formally nominate one candidate from the legislature's confirmed list.
    (f) **Advisory Report from the Public Tribune:** Upon nomination, the nominee's file shall be transmitted to the Office of the Public Tribune. The Tribune's Office shall produce its "Report on Judicial Fitness," as defined in Article 10, which shall be made public and delivered to the provincial Legislature.
    (g) **Final Confirmation by the Legislature:** The final appointment of a judge requires confirmation by a two-thirds supermajority vote of the full provincial Legislature. This confirmation vote may only be held after the Tribune's "Report on Judicial Fitness" has been publicly available for a minimum of fourteen days to ensure adequate time for legislative and public review.

**Section 2: Healthcare**

1.  **Supreme Governing Principles:** All provincial laws, funding, and administration of healthcare are subordinate to the Charter of Immutable Principles.
    (a) The purpose of the healthcare system is the preservation of life. Accordingly, any **act or deliberate omission** whose foreseeable consequence is the death of a human being prior to their natural death is prohibited. This prohibition includes, but is not limited to, abortion, euthanasia, assisted suicide, and the **withholding of hydration, nutrition, or other care that is standard for a patient's condition**. This clause does not abridge the right of an individual to refuse medical treatment for themselves.
    (b) The right of parents to direct the healthcare of their minor children is paramount. In any case of disagreement between parents, a court's jurisdiction is limited to determining which parent's proposed course of action most closely aligns with preserving the child's life and their **biologically determined sex and its corresponding pubertal development**.
    (c) Any person who performs a procedure proscribed by Article 3.4 of the Charter on a person below the age of medical majority shall be subject to criminal penalties, which must include, as a mandatory minimum, the **permanent revocation of any state-issued professional license**. Any institution where such a procedure is performed shall be subject to substantial financial penalties and a **mandatory minimum five-year ineligibility for any form of public funding**.

2.  **Structure of the Healthcare System:** The provincial healthcare system shall be a hybrid model.
    (a) **The Provincial Health Security Net:** A publicly funded system is established to guarantee access for all citizens to a defined basket of medical services for the diagnosis and treatment of **pathological disease or physical injury**. For the purpose of this Article, natural human processes, including but not limited to pregnancy, aging, and menopause, shall not be defined as a pathological disease or injury.
    (b) **The Private and Voluntary Sector:** The right of citizens to private medical care shall not be infringed. Any tax, fee, or regulation must be based on the **nature of the medical service provided, not on the corporate or financial structure of the provider**. No regulation may be imposed on a private facility that is not also imposed on a public facility providing the same service.

3.  **Administration and Standards:**
    (a) There is hereby established an independent **Provincial Health Standards Commission**. The Commission shall be composed of seven members serving single, non-renewable seven-year terms.
    (b) **Appointment and Removal Process:** The Commission shall be composed of: three members nominated by the Provincial Medical Association, two members nominated by the Council of Provincial Medical School Deans, and two members nominated by the acting Chief Justice of the province. The legislature may, by a two-thirds supermajority vote, create a confirmed list of candidates from these nominees. The final candidates must then be ratified by a two-thirds supermajority vote of the **Active Council of the Citizen's Oversight Tribune.** Commissioners can only be removed by the same process.
    (c) **Limited Mandate:** The Commission's mandate is strictly limited to: (i) defining and publishing the specific list of **procedures and treatments** covered by the Provincial Health Security Net; (ii) setting and enforcing province-wide standards for professional licensing and facility accreditation; and (iii) auditing health outcomes.

4.  **Fiscal Governance and Control:**
    (a) The list of covered procedures and treatments, herein referred to as the "Provincial Formulary," shall be a public document.
    (b) To prevent political coercion, the addition of any new procedure or treatment to the Provincial Formulary requires that the **legislature's ratification vote on the matter be a separate and distinct vote**, addressing only that single procedure or treatment. Approval requires a two-thirds supermajority.
    (c) To prevent sabotage through fiscal starvation, the total annual provincial budget for the Health Security Net must be, at minimum, equivalent to the previous year's budget adjusted for population growth and the **Provincial Health Price Index (PHPI)**. The PHPI shall be an official metric calculated annually by the independent Provincial Statistics Agency to specifically measure the inflation of medical goods and services. A reduction below this constitutional floor requires a three-quarters supermajority vote.

### ARTICLE IV: FEDERAL PUBLIC FINANCE

**Section 1: National Project Bonds**

1.  The Legislature may, under strict limitations, be granted the authority to fund specific, large-scale capital projects through the issuance of National Project Bonds, which shall be offered for voluntary purchase by the public.

2.  The Legislature shall pass a **National Project Bond Act** to define the specific procedures, but this Act must adhere to the following constitutional limitations:
    (a) All such bonds must be approved by a national, binding referendum.
    (b) The Act shall establish at least two classes of bonds: one for revenue-generating projects and one for non-revenue strategic projects.
    (c) The approval threshold for issuing bonds for non-revenue strategic projects must require, at minimum, a three-quarters supermajority in the Legislature and a two-thirds supermajority in the national referendum.
    (d) The total outstanding principal of all bonds for non-revenue strategic projects may not exceed five percent (5%) of the nation's Gross Domestic Product.

### ARTICLE V: THE REGULATED MILITIA OF THE PROVINCES

1.  **Principle and Purpose:** Pursuant to the principle recognized in Article 9 of the Charter of Immutable Principles, a system of well-regulated provincial militias is hereby established to provide for the common defense and to render aid in civil emergencies.

2.  **Composition and Structure:**
    (a) Each province shall raise, train, and maintain its own Regulated Militia.
    (b) Enlistment in the militia shall be strictly voluntary for all citizens who have attained the age of twenty and are not otherwise disqualified from bearing arms under the Charter.
    (c) The standard term of enlistment shall be for a period of six years.

3.  **Member Obligations:** Members shall be obligated to attend regular, paid training, not to exceed one weekend per month and two weeks per year. Members are expected to maintain their own standard personal arms in a state of readiness.

4.  **Government Obligations:**
    (a) The federal government shall establish uniform standards for militia training and equipment to ensure interoperability.
    (b) The provincial government shall be responsible for the administration, recruitment, and command of its militia in peacetime.

5.  **Activation and Command Protocol:** The militia is a defensive and civil support force with strictly defined activation protocols.
    (a) **Provincial Activation:** The executive head of a province may call the provincial militia to active duty to respond to a catastrophic natural disaster or to suppress violent insurrection within that province's borders.
    (b) **Federal Activation:** The militia may only be called into federal service and placed under federal command after a State of Emergency has been declared under the protocols of Article 7, Clause 6(a) of the Charter.

6.  **Protocol for Limited Civil Assistance.**
    (a) The Legislature is empowered to pass laws enabling the temporary assignment of militia personnel and equipment to provide support to Provincial Civil Authorities for the purpose of preventing imminent death or grievous bodily harm.
    (b) Any law passed under this authority must establish two distinct pathways for authorization:
        (i) **The Standard Path:** For foreseeable situations, a request for assistance must originate from a Provincial Minister or their designated Deputy-Minister, who must make a sworn declaration that the conditions for assistance have been met.
        (ii) **The Exigent Path:** In a sudden, localized emergency where a delay would result in the loss of life, a Designated Local Emergency Chief (as defined by provincial law) may request the immediate deployment of militia assets.
    (c) **Accountability Protocol for the Exigent Path:** Upon making an exigent request, the Local Emergency Chief must notify the responsible Provincial Minister without delay. The Minister must, within 90 minutes of being notified, conduct a review and issue a formal Ratification or Revocation of the mission, assuming full responsibility via a sworn declaration if ratified.
    (d) **Absolute Prohibitions:** All assistance missions are subject to the non-negotiable limitation that militia personnel shall not perform any law enforcement or security functions.

7.  **Prohibition on Misuse:** The militia shall never be used for routine law enforcement. The federal government has no authority to activate, command, or disarm any provincial militia except during a constitutionally declared State of Emergency for national defense.

2.  **Removal for Misconduct:** The Governor General may be removed from office only for gross misconduct or a severe violation of their oath.

3.  **Removal for Incapacity:** A Governor General may be removed from office if they become permanently unable to discharge their duties due to physical or mental incapacity. This process is initiated by a unanimous resolution of the Council of National Order, which must then be ratified by a simple majority vote in both legislative houses. Upon ratification, the office is declared vacant, and the Governor General is deemed to have been honourably retired. This process may not be used for reasons of policy disagreement or political unpopularity.

4.  **Succession:** In the event of the Governor General's death, resignation, or removal, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court shall serve as Administrator of the Government until a new Governor General is appointed through the process defined in Section 2.

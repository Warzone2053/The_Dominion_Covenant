# The Dominion Covenant

![Project Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-work--in--progress-yellow)

## Introduction

The Dominion Covenant is a comprehensive, first-principles thought experiment in constitutional design. It represents a complete architectural blueprint for a potential future Canada, rebuilt from the ground up on a foundation of enduring moral principles, limited government, and robust individual liberty.

This project is not a political program for the present day. Rather, it is a work of speculative statecraft designed to answer the question: If a nation were to face a "Year Zero" moment—a catastrophic collapse of its existing order—what framework could be erected from the ashes to ensure lasting faith, freedom, and justice?

The documents contained herein are a work-in-progress, representing a rigorous effort to build a system of government that is internally consistent, structurally sound, and philosophically coherent.

## Guiding Principles

The architecture of the Dominion Covenant is built upon several foundational pillars:

*   **Constitutional Supremacy & The Rule of Law:** The law is sovereign. All citizens and all branches of government, without exception, are subordinate to the plain meaning of the constitutional text.
*   **Christian Moral Foundation:** The nation's public life and moral character are grounded in the supreme moral law of the Holy Bible.
*   **Limited Government & Fiscal Sovereignty:** The power of the state is strictly enumerated and constitutionally limited. It is fiscally bound by a balanced operational budget and a hard cap on its power to tax.
*   **Individual Liberty & Personal Responsibility:** Rights are understood as divine endowments, not state grants. Chief among them are the rights to life, liberty, and property. These rights are intrinsically linked to a high view of personal duty and virtue.
*   **Decentralized Power & Subsidiarity:** To prevent the concentration of tyrannical power, authority is intentionally distributed among multiple competing institutions and pushed down to the lowest, most local level capable of exercising it.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into a clear hierarchy, moving from foundational principles to practical application.

*   **`/charters`**: The constitutional foundation of the project. These three documents form one, indivisible whole, outlining the nation's permanent moral principles, its inviolable rights, and the structure of its government.
*   **`/model_legislation`**: Practical examples of the key "Framework Acts" and statutes that would be enacted under the authority of the constitution. These documents demonstrate how the core principles are translated into the operational law of the land, covering everything from national defense to foreign policy.
*   **`/reference`**: Navigational and study aids for the project. Chief among these is the **[Defined Terms Concordance](reference/Defined_Terms_Concordance.md)**, an essential glossary that defines and cross-references the specific legal terms used throughout the Covenant.
*   **`/docs`**: Supporting documents related to the philosophical background, potential implementation, and transitional governance of the Covenant.

## Recommended Reading Path

For a reader new to the project, the following path is recommended for a comprehensive understanding:

1.  **The Preamble:** Begin with **[00. The Dominion Covenant](charters/00.%20The%20Dominion%20Covenant.md)**. This is the single-page "keystone" document that introduces the three core charters and their relationship.

2.  **The Foundational Charters:** Read the core constitution in the following order:
    *   **Part I: [The Core Immutable Principles](charters/01.%20THE%20CORE%20IMMUTABLE%20PRINCIPLES%20OF%20THE%20CONSTITUTION%20OF%20CANADA.md)** – The unchangeable soul of the nation, defining its absolute rights and the limits of state power.
    *   **Part II: [The Constitution of Government](charters/02.%20The%20Constitution%20of%20Government.md)** – The structural framework of the state, detailing the machinery of its legislative, executive, and judicial branches.
    *   **Part III: [The National Covenant](charters/03.%20The%20National%20Covenant.md)** – The moral compass of the nation, articulating the guiding virtues for its people and public life.

3.  **Theory into Practice:** Once the foundation is understood, explore a piece of model legislation to see how it works in practice. A good starting point is **[The National Militia Act](model_legislation/The%20National%20Militia%20Act.md)**, as it directly implements several of the Covenant's most unique principles.

4.  **Use the Concordance:** As you read, keep the **[Defined Terms Concordance](reference/Defined_Terms_Concordance.md)** open. It is an invaluable tool for understanding the precise legal meaning of capitalized terms used throughout the project.

## Current Status

This project is a developmental work-in-progress. The documents are subject to revision as logical inconsistencies, potential loopholes, and structural weaknesses are identified and corrected.

## Feedback & Engagement

This project is made available for the purpose of serious intellectual and philosophical review. Rigorous, good-faith criticism is welcome. Feedback should focus on:

*   Theological consistency and integrity.
*   Potential legal loopholes or ambiguities.
*   The risk of unintended consequences.
*   The structural soundness of the checks and balances.

## **DISCLAIMER**

**This project is a hypothetical and philosophical work of constitutional theory. It is an exploration of ideas and is intended for academic, theological, and political study ONLY.**

**The documents contained herein are NOT an incitement to violence, sedition, or the overthrow of any existing government. The framework is explicitly designed for a hypothetical *post-collapse* scenario and does not in any way advocate for, or provide a plan for, *causing* such a collapse.**

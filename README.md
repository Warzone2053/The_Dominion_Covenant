# The Dominion Covenant

## Introduction

The Dominion Covenant is a comprehensive, first-principles thought experiment in constitutional design. It represents a complete architectural blueprint for a potential future Canada, rebuilt from the ground up on a foundation of enduring moral principles, limited government, and robust individual liberty.

This project is not a political program for the present day. Rather, it is a work of speculative statecraft designed to answer the question: If a nation were to face a "Year Zero" moment—a catastrophic collapse of its existing order—what framework could be erected from the ashes to ensure lasting faith, freedom, and justice?

The documents contained herein are a work-in-progress, representing a rigorous effort to build a system of government that is internally consistent, structurally sound, and philosophically coherent.

## Guiding Principles

The architecture of the Dominion Covenant is built upon several foundational pillars:

*   **Constitutional Supremacy & The Rule of Law:** The law is sovereign. All citizens and all branches of government, without exception, are subordinate to the plain meaning of the constitutional text.
*   **Christian Moral Foundation:** The nation's public life and moral character are grounded in the supreme moral law of the Holy Bible.
*   **Limited Government & Fiscal Sovereignty:** The power of the state is strictly enumerated and constitutionally limited. It is fiscally bound by a balanced operational budget and a hard cap on its power to tax.
*   **Individual Liberty & Personal Responsibility:** Rights are understood as divine endowments, not state grants. Chief among them are the rights to life, liberty, and property. These rights are intrinsically linked to a high view of personal duty and virtue.
*   **Decentralized Power & Subsidiarity:** To prevent the concentration of tyrannical power, authority is intentionally distributed among multiple competing institutions and pushed down to the lowest, most local level capable of exercising it.

---

## Key Features

The Dominion Covenant introduces several unique constitutional structures designed to secure liberty and ensure accountability:

*   **The Public Tribune:** A powerful, independent fourth branch of government, staffed by a citizen jury, with the absolute authority to investigate and censure any part of the state, serving as the people's permanent watchdog.
*   **The Regulated Militia:** The prohibition of a professional standing army in favor of a decentralized, well-regulated provincial militia system based on universal service, placing the power of the sword irrevocably in the hands of the people.
*   **Fiscal State Mechanism:** A constitutionally mandated system that automatically adjusts the government's fiscal rules based on objective economic indicators, enforcing balanced budgets in normal times and allowing for limited, controlled deficits during crises.
*   **Framework Legislation:** A special class of constitutionally significant laws that require a supermajority to pass and amend, ensuring the stability of the nation's core institutions.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into a clear hierarchy, moving from foundational principles to practical application.

*   **`/charters`**: The constitutional foundation of the project. These three documents form one, indivisible whole, outlining the nation's permanent moral principles, its inviolable rights, and the structure of its government.
*   **`/model_legislation`**: Practical examples of the key "Framework Acts" and statutes that would be enacted under the authority of the constitution. These documents demonstrate how the core principles are translated into the operational law of the land, covering everything from national defense to foreign policy.
*   **`/reference`**: Navigational and study aids for the project. Chief among these is the **[Defined Terms Concordance](reference/Defined_Terms_Concordance.md)**, an essential glossary that defines and cross-references the specific legal terms used throughout the Covenant.
*   **`/docs`**: Supporting documents related to the philosophical background, potential implementation, and transitional governance of the Covenant.

## Recommended Reading Path

For a reader new to the project, the following path is recommended for a comprehensive understanding:

1.  **The Preamble:** Begin with **[00. The Dominion Covenant](charters/00.%20The%20Dominion%20Covenant.md)**. This is the single-page "keystone" document that introduces the three core charters and their relationship.

2.  **The Foundational Charters:** Read the core constitution in the following order:
    *   **Part I: [The Core Immutable Principles](charters/01.%20THE%20CORE%20IMMUTABLE%20PRINCIPLES%20OF%20THE%20CONSTITUTION%20OF%20CANADA.md)** – The unchangeable soul of the nation, defining its absolute rights and the limits of state power.
    *   **Part II: [The Constitution of Government](charters/02.%20The%20Constitution%20of%20Government.md)** – The structural framework of the state, detailing the machinery of its legislative, executive, and judicial branches.
    *   **Part III: [The National Covenant](charters/03.%20The%20National%20Covenant.md)** – The moral compass of the nation, articulating the guiding virtues for its people and public life.

3.  **Theory into Practice:** Once the foundation is understood, explore a piece of model legislation to see how it works in practice. A good starting point is **[The National Militia Act](model_legislation/The%20National%20Militia%20Act.md)**, as it directly implements several of the Covenant's most unique principles.

4.  **The "Why" Behind the "What":** After grasping the structure, read the foundational **Memorandums** to understand the core philosophy and first principles that motivated the design choices.

5.  **Use the Concordance:** As you read, keep the **[Defined Terms Concordance](reference/Defined_Terms_Concordance.md)** open. It is an invaluable tool for understanding the precise legal meaning of capitalized terms used throughout the project.

## Philosophical Context: The Memorandums

While the Charters and Model Legislation provide the "what" of the Dominion Covenant, the **Memorandums** provide the essential "why." They are the architect's commentary, explaining the first principles and the philosophical choices behind the Covenant's most significant and unique features. Understanding these documents is critical to understanding the soul of the project.

*   **[Memorandum on the Philosophy and Architecture of the Dominion Covenant](docs/Memorandum%20on%20the%20Philosophy%20and%20Architecture%20of%20the%20Dominion%20Covenant.md)**: The master key to the project. It explains the "Year Zero" premise and the Trinitarian architecture that unites the three core charters into a single, coherent whole.

*   **[Memorandum on the Hermeneutics of Law: A New Covenant Theonomy](docs/Memorandum%20on%20the%20Hermeneutics%20of%20Law%20A%20New%20Covenant%20Theonomy.md)**: The definitive hermeneutical guide to the project. It explains the Covenant's unique Christ-centered method for applying the *whole* of Scripture to civil law, defining its philosophy as a "New Covenant Theonomy."

*   **[Memorandum on the Divine Foundation of Law](docs/Memorandum%20on%20the%20Divine%20Foundation%20of%20Law.md)**: A defense of the project's most fundamental choice: founding the state on the authority of Divine Law (Theonomy) rather than secular humanism. It argues that a Covenanted State is the only viable path to lasting liberty.

*   **[Memorandum on the Preservation of Life](docs/Memorandum%20on%20the%20Preservation%20of%20Life.md)**: Explains the theological foundation for the Covenant's master principle—the sanctity of life—and provides the definitive rationale for both prohibiting abortion and prudentially abolishing capital punishment.

*   **[Memorandum on the Doctrine of the Sword](docs/Memorandum%20on%20the%20Doctrine%20of%20the%20Sword%20and%20the%20Office%20of%20the%20Citizen-Soldier.md)**: Explains the reasoning behind the absolute prohibition of a professional standing army and the constitutional necessity of a well-regulated citizen militia as the ultimate guarantor of domestic liberty.

*   **[Memorandum on the Commonwealth of Nations](docs/Memorandum%20on%20the%20Commonwealth%20of%20Nations%20and%20the%20Principle%20of%20Sovereign%20Partnership.md)**: Clarifies the Covenant's foreign policy stance, rejecting membership in the modern Commonwealth in favor of a new, stronger "Sovereign Compact" among core Westminster nations.

# Project Overview: A New Constitutional Framework for Canada

## 1. Core Identity: A Tribunician-Confessional Republic

This project designs a new system of government for Canada, best described as a **Tribunician-Confessional Republic**.

*   **Confessional:** The nation is founded on a declared moral framework derived from the Holy Bible, as articulated in the **National Covenant**. Its laws and public identity are explicitly grounded in this religious and moral tradition.
*   **Tribunician:** The system creates a powerful fourth branch of government—the **Office of the Public Tribune**—an independent, non-partisan body with its own citizen jury. It acts as a permanent watchdog with the authority to investigate all levels of government and hold them accountable to the people.

## 2. Guiding Philosophy

All articles of the constitution are built upon four foundational principles:
1.  **A Biblical Moral Framework:** The ultimate source of the nation's morality and law.
2.  **Individual Liberty and Responsibility:** Respect for God-given freewill, rights, and duties.
3.  **Skepticism of Concentrated Power:** A commitment to diffusing, checking, and balancing authority.
4.  **Limited Government and Fiscal Prudence:** A belief that the state's role must be strictly and constitutionally limited.

## 3. Constitutional Architecture

The framework, known as the **Dominion Covenant**, is a unified whole composed of three distinct but interconnected charters:

---

### Part I: The Core Immutable Principles
*(The nation's permanent, unamendable soul. These principles establish fundamental rights and absolute limits on state power.)*

*   **Article 1: The Sanctity of Life:** Establishes life as sacred from conception to natural death, prohibiting abortion, euthanasia, and capital punishment.
*   **Article 2: The Divine Foundation and the Freedom of Conscience:** Consecrates the nation to God while guaranteeing individual freedom of conscience and worship.
*   **Article 3: The Nature of the Family and Marriage:** Defines marriage as between one man and one woman, establishes strong parental rights, and sets the age of medical majority at twenty-one to protect minors from irreversible procedures.
*   **Article 4: Freedom of Speech and Truthful Expression:** Protects robust speech with specific, narrow exceptions (defamation, incitement, etc.).
*   **Article 5: Security From Unreasonable State Intrusion:** Guarantees security against unreasonable search and seizure, with a strict warrant mandate and exclusionary rule.
*   **Article 6: Rights of the Accused and Fairness in Justice:** Establishes the rights to a Grand Jury, protection from double jeopardy, the right to silence, and a fair trial.
*   **Article 7: Property, Stewardship, and Sound Money:** Establishes property rights, strict constitutional caps on federal taxation as a share of GDP, and mandates balanced operational budgets.
*   **Article 8: Private Charity and National Benevolence:** Protects and empowers private and religious charities as the primary means of social support.
*   **Article 9: The Right of the People to Keep and Bear Arms:** Guarantees the right to own conventional arms for self-defense, with strict prohibitions on registries and confiscation.
*   **Article 10: The Office of the Public Tribune:** Establishes the Tribune's mandate as the people's watchdog to expose corruption, mismanagement, and waste.
*   **Article 11: Equality of Rights and Responsibility:** Guarantees equality of individual opportunity before the law, regardless of sex.
*   **Article 12: National Sovereignty:** Asserts the supremacy of the nation's constitution over international law and prohibits foreign influence in domestic politics.

### Part II: The Constitution of Government
*(The nation's operational machinery, amendable only by a difficult three-stage process: a 2/3 legislative supermajority, ratification by 2/3 of the provinces, and a national binding referendum.)*

*   **Article I: Amendment Process:** Defines the high-bar process for amending this document.
*   **Article II: Local and Municipal Governance:** Establishes governance at the lowest level based on subsidiarity, with powers limited to local affairs and finances controlled by binding citizen referendums on property tax rates.
*   **Article III: Provincial Government:** Fortifies provincial powers to resist federal overreach.
    *   **Administration of Justice:** Power is separated by vesting criminal prosecutions in an independent **Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP)**, insulating them from political control. A multi-stage, merit-based process governs judicial appointments.
    *   **Healthcare:** Mandates a hybrid system with a public "Health Security Net" for essential care and a protected private sector, both governed by an independent standards commission and subordinate to the pro-life principles of the Charter.
*   **Article IV: Federal Public Finance:** Outlines the strict protocols for issuing **National Project Bonds** for major capital works, requiring public referendums.
*   **Article V: The Regulated Militia of the Provinces:** Establishes voluntary, provincially-controlled militias for civil emergencies and common defense, with strict limits on their use.
*   **Article VI: The Office of the Head of State:** Defines the role of the Governor General as a non-partisan guardian of the constitution, appointed through a merit-based council.
*   **Article VII: The National Legislature:** A bicameral system designed to prevent centralized party control.
    *   **House of Commons:** Represents the people. Members are elected via a majority-support system (e.g., ranked-choice), and ballots are neutral (no party affiliations listed). Accountability is enforced by term limits and a **Fiscal Performance Modifier** that cuts legislative pay after a deficit year.
    *   **Senate:** Represents the provinces, with ten Senators per province chosen by their provincial legislature to ensure regional interests are protected. It holds co-equal power with the House.
*   **Article VIII: The Supreme Court of Canada:** The final guardian of the Constitution.
    *   Justices are appointed for a single 18-year term via a rigorous multi-stage process involving provincial councils, a national commission, the Prime Minister, and the Senate.
    *   Its interpretive power is strictly limited by the **Rule of Constitutional Supremacy**, which binds it to the plain meaning of the text.
*   **Article IX: The Office of the Public Tribune:** Details the operational powers of the Tribune.
    *   The **Tribune General** is appointed via a supermajority confirmation process to a single 10-year term.
    *   The Office's funding is guaranteed by a constitutional formula, independent of the legislature's annual budget process, ensuring it cannot be defunded or starved.
    *   Possesses the power of subpoena to compel testimony and evidence from any government official or agency.

### Part III: The National Covenant
*(The nation's moral soul. It is a non-justiciable charter that articulates the guiding virtues for citizens, families, communities, and leaders, intended to serve as the moral compass for legislation and public life.)*

## 4. Project Status and Next Steps

The philosophical foundation, the core principles, the moral covenant, and the detailed structures for the legislative, judicial, provincial, and Tribune branches are substantially complete. The project has a solid and cohesive architectural framework.

The next priorities are:

1.  **Fully Define the Federal Executive:** Draft a new article in the **Constitution of Government** detailing the specific powers, duties, and limitations of the Prime Minister and the Cabinet.
2.  **Harmonize the Charters:** Review all documents for consistency. The most pressing issue is to resolve the contradiction regarding the final authority for provincial judicial appointments (is it the Legislature or the Public Tribune?).
3.  **Stress-Test the System:** Add mechanisms to resolve potential points of failure, such as creating a clear deadlock-breaking protocol for when the co-equal House and Senate cannot agree on critical legislation.

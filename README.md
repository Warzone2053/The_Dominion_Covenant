# The Dominion Covenant

![Project Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-work--in--progress-yellow)

## Introduction

The Dominion Covenant is a comprehensive, first-principles thought experiment in constitutional design. It represents a complete architectural blueprint for a potential future Canada, rebuilt from the ground up on a foundation of enduring moral principles, limited government, and robust individual liberty.

This project is not a political program for the present day. Rather, it is a work of speculative statecraft designed to answer the question: If a nation were to face a "Year Zero" moment—a catastrophic collapse of its existing order—what framework could be erected from the ashes to ensure lasting faith, freedom, and justice?

The documents contained herein are a work-in-progress, representing a rigorous effort to build a system of government that is internally consistent, structurally sound, and philosophically coherent.

## Guiding Principles

The architecture of the Dominion Covenant is built upon several foundational pillars:

*   **Constitutional Supremacy & The Rule of Law:** The law is sovereign. All citizens and all branches of government, without exception, are subordinate to the plain meaning of the constitutional text.
*   **Christian Moral Foundation:** The nation's public life and moral character are grounded in the supreme moral law of the Holy Bible.
*   **Limited Government & Fiscal Sovereignty:** The power of the state is strictly enumerated and constitutionally limited. It is fiscally bound by a balanced operational budget and a hard cap on its power to tax.
*   **Individual Liberty & Personal Responsibility:** Rights are understood as divine endowments, not state grants. Chief among them are the rights to life, liberty, and property. These rights are intrinsically linked to a high view of personal duty and virtue.
*   **Decentralized Power & Subsidiarity:** To prevent the concentration of tyrannical power, authority is intentionally distributed among multiple competing institutions and pushed down to the lowest, most local level capable of exercising it.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into several key directories:

*   `/charters`: Contains the three foundational documents that form the Dominion Covenant itself.
*   `/model_legislation`: Provides examples of key statutes that would be enacted under the authority of the new constitution, demonstrating how its principles translate into practical law.
*   `/docs`: Includes supporting documents related to the philosophical background, potential implementation, and transitional governance of the Covenant.

## The Core Charters

The Dominion Covenant is comprised of three integrated parts that form one indivisible whole:

> *   **Part I: [The Core Immutable Principles](charters/01.%20THE%20CORE%20IMMUTABLE%20PRINCIPLES%20OF%20THE%20CONSTITUTION%20OF%20CANADA.md)**
>     *   *The unchangeable foundation establishing the nation's fundamental rights and the absolute limits of state power.*
>
> *   **Part II: [The Constitution of Government](charters/02.%20The%20Constitution%20of%20Government.md)**
>     *   *The framework of the state, detailing the structure, powers, and procedures of its legislative, executive, and judicial branches.*
>
> *   **Part III: [The National Covenant](charters/03.%20The%20National%20Covenant.md)**
>     *   *The moral compass of the nation, articulating the guiding virtues for its people and public life.*

## Current Status

This project is a developmental work-in-progress. The documents are subject to revision as logical inconsistencies, potential loopholes, and structural weaknesses are identified and corrected.

## Feedback & Engagement

This project is made available for the purpose of serious intellectual and philosophical review. Rigorous, good-faith criticism is welcome. Feedback should focus on:

*   Theological consistency and integrity.
*   Potential legal loopholes or ambiguities.
*   The risk of unintended consequences.
*   The structural soundness of the checks and balances.

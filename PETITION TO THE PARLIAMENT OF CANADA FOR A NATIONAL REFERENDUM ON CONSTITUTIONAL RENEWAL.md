**PETITION TO THE PARLIAMENT OF CANADA FOR A NATIONAL REFERENDUM ON CONSTITUTIONAL RENEWAL**

**TO THE HONOURABLE HOUSE OF COMMONS IN PARLIAMENT ASSEMBLED:**

**WHEREAS,** the ultimate source of all just political authority in this nation is the sovereign will of the Canadian people;

**WHEREAS,** the nation faces a profound crisis of confidence in its governing institutions, its economic stability, and its national identity;

**WHEREAS,** it is the right of the people to alter or replace their form of government when it ceases to serve the ends for which it was established;

**AND WHEREAS,** a comprehensive new framework for governance, entitled "The Constitution of Canada" and its accompanying "Charter of Immutable Principles," has been proposed as a path to restore the nation's freedom, prosperity, and moral foundations;

**THEREFORE, WE, THE UNDERSIGNED, CITIZENS OF CANADA,** humbly pray and petition that Parliament immediately introduce legislation to authorize a national, binding referendum for the purpose of seeking a National Supermajority Mandate on the following clear and unambiguous question:

***"Do you approve the adoption of the new Constitution of Canada and its accompanying Charter of Immutable Principles, thereby repealing and replacing all previous constitutional documents and acts?"***

And as in duty bound, your petitioners will ever pray.

# The Dominion Covenant - Code of Conduct

---

### Our Pledge

As contributors and maintainers of the Dominion Covenant project, we pledge to make participation a respectful, intellectually honest, and productive experience for everyone. This project is a forum for a rigorous and serious thought experiment in constitutional design, and our code of conduct is designed to protect that mission.

We are committed to a collaborative environment where ideas can be challenged and debated with clarity and mutual respect, and where persons are treated with dignity.

### Our Standards: Expected Conduct

To create a positive and intellectually fruitful environment, contributors are expected to:

*   **Engage in Good Faith:** All discussion must be conducted with intellectual honesty. The goal is a shared pursuit of a more perfect model, not to "win" an argument.
*   **Demonstrate Respect for Persons:** While we will rigorously debate and criticize ideas, we will not attack the personhood or character of other contributors.
*   **Practice Civility and Forbearance:** Disagreements are inevitable, but they must be handled with patience, reason, and a commitment to understanding other perspectives.
*   **Focus on the Substance:** All contributions and comments should be focused on strengthening the project's integrity. Arguments should be supported by logic, evidence, and a clear understanding of the project's foundational goals.

### Unacceptable Conduct

To maintain a high standard of discourse, the following behaviors are strictly prohibited and will be considered violations of this Code of Conduct:

*   **Personal Attacks:** Attacking, insulting, or belittling a person rather than their ideas.
*   **Bad-Faith Engagement:** Trolling, deliberate misrepresentation of arguments, or engaging in a manner intended to disrupt or derail productive conversation.
*   **Incitement and Dehumanization:** Advocating or glorifying violence, or promoting the denial of any person's fundamental human dignity.
*   **Harassment:** This includes, but is not limited to, unwelcome sexual attention, threats, intimidation, or the repeated posting of private information of others without their consent.
*   **Spam and Off-Topic Promotion:** Submitting content that is not relevant to the project's purpose.
*   **Persistent Refusal to Engage with the Project's Foundation:** This project's purpose is to build upon its established first principles. Continual attempts to litigate or subvert these principles, rather than building upon them, will be considered disruptive.

### Enforcement

*   The project owner is responsible for enforcing this Code of Conduct and has the final say in its interpretation.
*   Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project owner directly.
*   Any contributor who violates this Code of Conduct will, at the discretion of the project owner, be subject to an immediate and permanent ban from all project spaces, including the GitHub repository and any associated discussion forums.

This policy exists to protect the *dity and rights of persons*, not to shield *ideas* from rigorous and critical debate.

# The Constitutional Transition and Inauguration Act

---

### PREAMBLE

This Act provides the legal and procedural framework for the peaceful and orderly transition from the prior system of government to the new Republic, founded upon the Constitution of Canada and its Charter of Immutable Principles. Its authority is derived from the sovereign will of the Canadian people, as expressed in the National Ratification Referendum. This Act shall have the force of supreme law for the duration of the transition period, after which it shall be considered executed and retired.

### PHASE 1: THE NATIONAL RATIFICATION PROTOCOL (THE DECISION)

**Article 1: The Constitutional Referendum**

1.  A National Ratification Referendum shall be held to secure the consent of the governed for this historic transition.
2.  The ballot shall contain a single, unambiguous question: *"Do you approve the adoption of the new Constitution of Canada and its accompanying Charter of Immutable Principles, thereby repealing and replacing all previous constitutional documents and acts?"*
3.  Leading up to the referendum, there shall be a six-month Public Education Period, during which the full text of the proposed constitutional documents shall be distributed to every household and debated widely in public forums.

**Article 2: The Mandate for Transition**

1.  The new constitutional order shall be considered ratified only upon securing a **National Supermajority Mandate**, which is defined as:
    (a) A minimum of **sixty percent (60%)** of the national popular vote in favor of the new constitution.
    (b) A simple majority (50%+1) of the popular vote in favor of the new constitution in at least **seven of the ten (7/10)** provinces.
2.  If this mandate is achieved, the result is binding and irrevocable. The transition process shall commence immediately as defined in Phase 2. The legitimacy of the old order is considered to have expired, and all authority now flows from this popular mandate.

**Article 4: Mandate and Limitations of the Council**

3.  Any judge who refuses to swear the new oath shall be deemed to have resigned their position, and a vacancy shall be declared.

**Article 11: Economic Stability Mandate**

2.  The Governor is empowered to take all necessary measures to defend the currency, ensure the liquidity of the banking system, and maintain the stability of financial markets.

2.  An Emergency Decree may only be issued with the **unanimous consent of all seven members** of the Council.
3.  The Decree shall have the temporary force of law but must be narrowly tailored to address the specific crisis.
4.  Any such Decree automatically expires on Inauguration Day (the 180th day). It can only be made permanent if it is ratified and passed as a new law by the incoming Legislature.

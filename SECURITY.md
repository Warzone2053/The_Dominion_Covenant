# Security Policy for The Dominion Covenant

---

### 1. The Nature of this Project

The Dominion Covenant is a constitutional and legislative framework presented as a series of documents. It is **not** a software project and contains no executable code.

Therefore, traditional software security vulnerabilities (such as remote code execution, cross-site scripting, etc.) do not apply to this repository.

### 2. Reporting Conceptual "Vulnerabilities"

In the context of this project, a "vulnerability" is defined as:

*   A **legal loophole** in a charter or piece of model legislation.
*   An **internal contradiction** between two or more articles.
*   A clause or provision that could be **abused by the state** to undermine liberty or the rule of law.
*   Any other **conceptual or structural weakness** that compromises the integrity of the constitutional framework.

The identification and patching of these conceptual vulnerabilities is the primary goal of our collaborative process.

### 3. Reporting Process

To ensure a transparent and robust "red-teaming" process, all conceptual vulnerabilities should be reported **publicly** through the designated channels. **Please do NOT report conceptual flaws via private email or other non-public means.**

*   **For specific, actionable proposals** to fix a loophole or inconsistency, please open a new **[GitHub Issue](https://github.com/YourUsername/The-Dominion-Covenant/issues)**. Clearly describe the vulnerability and your proposed solution.

*   **For broader, high-level discussions** about a potential weakness or philosophical concern, please start a new thread in our **[GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/YourUsername/The-Dominion-Covenant/discussions)** tab.

For a complete guide on how to contribute and structure your proposals, please consult our primary guide for collaborators: **[`BECOMING_A_COLLABORATOR.md`](/docs/BECOMING_A_COLLABORATOR.md)**.

We thank you for your commitment to strengthening the integrity of this framework.

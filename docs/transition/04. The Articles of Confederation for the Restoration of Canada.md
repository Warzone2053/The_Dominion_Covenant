### PREAMBLE

We, the delegates of the restored, free, and sovereign Provinces of [List of Founding Provinces], having each re-established just and orderly government under the supreme law of The Dominion Covenant, seek to form a more perfect union to provide for our common defense, promote our mutual welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty until such time as the entire nation can be restored.

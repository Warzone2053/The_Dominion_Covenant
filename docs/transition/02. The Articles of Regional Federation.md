# The Articles of Regional Federation

---

### PREAMBLE

We, the undersigned Covenant Freeholds, having each secured our own communities under the authority of the **Mandate for Local Restoration** and the supreme law of the **Core Immutable Principles**, recognize that our continued liberty and security depend upon common action.

A single town is a fortress, but a union of towns is a nation.

Therefore, to provide for our common defense, to establish a zone of free and honest commerce, to secure the blessings of liberty for ourselves and our posterity, and to create a larger beacon of order from which the nation may be rebuilt, we do hereby enter into this perpetual Federation, adopting these Articles as the supreme law of our newly constituted **Covenant Region**.

### ARTICLE I: FORMATION OF THE FEDERATION

(1) The signatory Covenant Freeholds do hereby unite to form a new, sovereign entity to be known as **The [Name of Region] Regional Federation**.

(2) This Federation is a voluntary union of sovereign Freeholds. All powers not expressly delegated to the Regional Council by these Articles are reserved to the people and their local Restoration Councils.

### ARTICLE II: THE REGIONAL COUNCIL

(1) All legislative and executive authority for this Federation is hereby vested in a **Regional Council**, which shall be composed of one delegate from each member Freehold.

(2) Each delegate shall be chosen by the Restoration Council of their respective Freehold and shall serve at their pleasure.

(3) The Regional Council shall elect a Chair from among its own members to preside over its meetings and to act as the chief executive officer of the Federation. The Council shall act by a majority vote of its delegates.

### ARTICLE III: ENUMERATED POWERS OF THE REGIONAL COUNCIL

The Regional Council shall have the power, and only the power, to:

(1) **Provide for the Common Defense:** To organize, fund, and command a unified **Regional Militia**, composed of the contingents of each member Freehold. This includes the power to appoint a single commanding officer for the region and to direct military operations in defense of the entire Federation.

(2) **Secure Regional Commerce:** To regulate travel and trade *between* member Freeholds, to establish and maintain key transportation routes (major roads, bridges, waterways), and to create a common system of weights, measures, and currency for the region.

(3) **Administer Regional Justice:** To establish a Regional Court of Justice, which shall have original jurisdiction over disputes *between* member Freeholds and appellate jurisdiction over criminal cases of the most severe nature as defined by the Council.

(4) **Conduct External Relations:** To act as the single, unified voice of the Federation in all dealings with other communities, regions, or external powers.

### ARTICLE IV: ADMISSION OF NEW MEMBERS

(1) Any neighboring Covenant Freehold that has successfully implemented the **Mandate for Local Restoration** may petition the Regional Council for admission into this Federation.

(2) Admission requires the affirmative vote of a **two-thirds supermajority** of the delegates of the Regional Council.

(3) Upon admission, the new member Freehold shall be granted all the rights and be subject to all the duties and obligations of these Articles, including the right to representation on the Regional Council.

### ARTICLE V: SUPREMACY AND DISSOLUTION

(1) **Supremacy:** These Articles shall be the supreme law of this Covenant Region. Any law or action of a member Freehold that is in conflict with these Articles is void. The **Core Immutable Principles** remain the supreme moral law, binding upon all levels of government.

(2) **The Sunset Clause:** The Regional Council is a temporary government, formed out of necessity to bridge the gap between local order and a restored Province. This Federation and its Council shall **immediately, automatically, and irrevocably dissolve** at the moment its member Freeholds participate in the founding of a new Provincial Government under the **Act of Provincial Founding**.

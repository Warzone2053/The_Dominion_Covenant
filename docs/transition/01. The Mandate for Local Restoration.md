# The Mandate for Local Restoration

---

### PREAMBLE

WHEREAS all higher orders of government—municipal, provincial, and federal—have collapsed and their authority is hereby rendered void;

AND WHEREAS we, the people of this community, are left in a state of nature, possessing the inherent right to self-preservation and the establishment of a just and ordered society to secure our lives, liberty, and property;

AND WHEREAS we choose order over chaos, liberty under law over the tyranny of the strong, and a future of hope over a present of fear;

NOW THEREFORE, we, the free citizens of this community, do hereby enact this Mandate, constituting ourselves as a self-governing and sovereign **Covenant Freehold**.

### ARTICLE I: THE RESTORATION COUNCIL

(1) **Formation:** All executive and legislative authority for this Covenant Freehold is hereby vested in a temporary body of three, to be known as the **Restoration Council**.

(2) **Composition:** The Council shall be composed of:
    (a) The senior-most local peace officer (e.g., Sheriff, Police Chief) who publicly swears an oath to this Mandate.
    (b) The Mayor or senior-most local elected official who publicly swears an oath to this Mandate.
    (c) In the event either of the above is unable or unwilling to serve, or if both positions are vacant, a respected private citizen shall be chosen by a public assembly of the community's citizens. The Council must have three members.

(3) **Mandate:** The Council's sole purpose is to secure this community and govern it according to the principles of this Mandate, creating a sanctuary of law and order.

### ARTICLE II: THE IMMEDIATE DIRECTIVES

(1) **Secure the Community:** The Council shall immediately organize a volunteer **Community Militia** under the command of the peace officer, as provided for in Article III. This Militia's first duty is to secure the borders of our community and to protect its critical resources—food, water, fuel, and medical supplies.

(2) **Establish the Bedrock Law:** The Council shall immediately declare the **Core Immutable Principles** of The Dominion Covenant to be the supreme and binding law of this Covenant Freehold. All actions of the Council and all citizens are subject to these Principles.

(3) **Administer Justice:** The Council shall establish a temporary court of justice, presided over by a local judge or respected citizen, to adjudicate disputes and punish criminal acts in accordance with the Bedrock Law.

(4) **The Expansion Directive:** The Council is commanded to immediately attempt to make contact with neighboring communities. Its highest external duty is to encourage other communities to adopt this Mandate and to seek federation with them under the **Articles of Regional Federation**, thereby expanding the zone of stability.

---

### ARTICLE III: THE COMMUNITY MILITIA

(1) All able-bodied citizens of this Freehold have a duty to participate in the common defense.

(2) The Council shall, under its security member, organize, train, and equip a well-regulated Community Militia.

(3) This Militia is the sole legitimate armed force of this Freehold. Its purpose is defensive only. It exists to protect this community from external threats and to maintain the peace within it.

### ARTICLE IV: SUPREMACY AND DISSOLUTION

(1) **Supremacy:** This Mandate is the supreme law of this Covenant Freehold, superseding all laws of the defunct regimes.

(2) **The Sunset Clause:** The Restoration Council is a temporary shield. It shall dissolve and its powers shall be transferred to a larger, more permanent body at the moment this Covenant Freehold formally ratifies the **Articles of Regional Federation** and its citizens are granted representation in that new regional government.

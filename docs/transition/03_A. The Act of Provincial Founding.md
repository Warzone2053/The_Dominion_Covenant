### PREAMBLE

WHEREAS a majority of the sovereign Covenant Regions within the historic bounds of this Province have, through the courage and diligence of their people, restored order, justice, and liberty under law;

AND WHEREAS the security and prosperity of these regions can only be made permanent through the establishment of a larger, unified, and constitutional government for the entire Province;

AND WHEREAS the time has come to take the final step in rebuilding our society from the grassroots up, and to present a single, strong, and united front to aid in the restoration of the nation;

NOW THEREFORE, the undersigned Covenant Regions, acting through their duly appointed delegates, do hereby enact this Act, dissolving their temporary federations and constituting themselves as a single, free, and restored **Province of [Name of Province]**.

### ARTICLE IV: THE THREEFOLD MANDATE FOR RESTORATION

(1) **The Mandate Defined:** The restored Province is not an end in itself. It is a secure base of operations for a greater mission. The Provincial Government is therefore charged with a threefold mandate:
    (a) To complete the restoration of order within its own historic borders (**The Provincial Mandate**).
    (b) To aid its neighbors in establishing their own zones of order (**The Samaritan Mandate**).
    (c) To join with other restored provinces to rebuild the nation (**The National Mandate**).

(2) **The Provincial Mandate (Secure and Integrate):**
    (a) The Provincial Government's first duty is to the peaceful and voluntary integration of all remaining territories within its jurisdiction.
    (b) It shall extend an open invitation and provide logistical support to all un-federated communities to adopt the **Mandate for Local Restoration** and join the provincial body politic.
    (c) The Provincial Militia shall be deployed as necessary *within provincial borders* to assist these communities in securing their territory against lawless elements.

(3) **The Samaritan Mandate (Assist and Empower):**
    (a) Recognizing that a strong neighbor is the best ally, the Provincial Government is authorized to provide aid to communities and regions located directly adjacent to its borders, but which lie within the historic territory of a different province.
    (b) This aid shall be for the sole and exclusive purpose of helping those communities establish their own independent **Covenant Freeholds** and **Covenant Regions**, with the ultimate goal of them forming their own restored province.
    (c) **Strict Prohibitions:** Under this mandate, the Provincial Government is irrevocably prohibited from:
        (i) Attempting to annex any territory outside its historic borders.
        (ii) Creating any state of dependency or demanding any form of tribute.
        (iii) Interfering in the internal governance of a neighboring Freehold or Region once it is secure.
    (d) Aid provided shall be limited to logistical support, sharing of organizational templates, and, where formally requested, temporary joint militia operations to neutralize a shared, cross-border threat.

(4) **The National Mandate (Federate and Restore):**
    (a) The Provincial Government is commanded to seek out and enter into formal communication with other fully restored provinces.
    (b) When at least two-thirds (7 of 10) of the historic provinces have been restored, this government shall send delegates to a National Constitutional Convention to enact the **Constitutional Transition and Inauguration Act** and restore the national government.

### ARTICLE V: SUPREMACY AND DISSOLUTION

(1) **Supremacy:** This Act and the laws passed by the Provincial Assembly shall be the supreme law of this Province, subordinate only to the principles of The Dominion Covenant itself.

(2) **The Sunset Clause:** The provisional government established by this Act is a temporary institution. It shall **immediately, automatically, and irrevocably dissolve** and transfer all its sovereign powers to the new national government at the precise moment that the first Prime Minister and Cabinet of Canada are sworn into office under the fully ratified Dominion Covenant.

# The Restoration Pathway: A Guide to the Transitional Documents

---

### Preamble: The "Secure, Rebuild, and Repeat" Model

The documents in this directory answer the crucial question: In the event of a "Year Zero" national collapse, how is a just and constitutional order restored?

This framework rejects a model of restoration imposed by a pre-selected national authority. Instead, it codifies a feasible, organic, and grassroots model of national rebirth, built on the principle of **"Secure, Rebuild, and Repeat."**

The pathway begins with a single, small community restoring order to itself and grows exponentially as these secure "cells" of liberty federate into larger and more stable bodies, culminating in the restoration of the entire nation. These documents provide the sequential, legal templates for each stage of that journey.

### The Pathway: A Step-by-Step Guide

The documents are numbered to be read in sequence. Each represents a distinct and necessary stage in the transition from local chaos to national constitutional order.

#### **Stage 0: The Spark**
*   **Document:** `00. A Declaration for the Restoration of Canada.md`
*   **Purpose:** The ideological foundation. This is the manifesto that articulates the failures of the old order and presents the vision of The Dominion Covenant. It is the common idea that inspires and justifies the restoration movement.

#### **Stage 1: The Cell (The Local Freehold)**
*   **Document:** `01. The Mandate for Local Restoration.md`
*   **Purpose:** The cornerstone of the entire model. This is the legal template by which a single town or community can constitute itself as a sovereign "Covenant Freehold," creating a secure and self-governing zone of order.

#### **Stage 2: The Organism (The Regional Federation)**
*   **Document:** `02. The Articles of Regional Federation.md`
*   **Purpose:** The first expansion phase. This simple treaty allows multiple, neighboring "Covenant Freeholds" to unite for common defense and commerce, forming a larger and more resilient "Covenant Region."

#### **Stage 3: The Body Politic (The Province or Territory)**
*   **Documents:**
    *   `03_A. The Act of Provincial Founding.md`
    *   `03_B. The Act of Territorial Founding and Provincehood.md`
*   **Purpose:** The major scaling-up. These parallel documents provide the framework for a critical mass of "Covenant Regions" to reconstitute a full, recognizable Provincial or Territorial government, complete with a unified militia and a provisional legislature.

#### **Stage 4: The Alliance (The Confederation)**
*   **Document:** `04. The Articles of Confederation for the Restoration of Canada.md`
*   **Purpose:** The pre-national phase. This is a "league of friendship" treaty that allows the newly restored, sovereign Provinces and Territories to act as a unified bloc for common defense and foreign policy, building trust before the final step of national union.

#### **Stage 5: The Nation Reborn (The Inauguration)**
*   **Document:** `05. The Constitutional Transition and Inauguration Act.md`
*   **Purpose:** The end game. This is the final, procedural script that is enacted once a supermajority of provinces have joined the Confederation. It governs the first national election and the inauguration of the first permanent government under the full Dominion Covenant, thereby dissolving all temporary transitional bodies.

# A DECLARATION FOR THE RESTORATION OF CANADA

---

### PREAMBLE

This is not a petition for redress. We are long past asking for reforms from a system that is deaf to reason and blind to its own decay. This is a declaration of intent, a final warning, and a sacred promise to our children. The nation founded by our forefathers is dying, and we will not stand idly by to watch it draw its last, managed breath. We will restore it, or we will build it anew from the ashes.

### I. THE INDICTMENT

Look around you. This is not the strong, free, and prosperous nation we were promised. This is a house built on sand, sinking under the weight of its own lies.

We are told we are wealthy, yet we are a nation of debt slaves. A government without limit borrows against our children's future to fund its present corruption, while the dollar in your pocket is silently stolen by the slow poison of inflation.

We are told we are free, yet our speech is policed for "wrong-think," our property is taxed into oblivion, our firearms are confiscated like those of a conquered people, and our parental authority is usurped by a state that believes it owns our children.

We are told we are compassionate, yet we have cultivated a culture of death. We extinguish the lives of the unborn in the name of convenience and euthanize the elderly in the name of "dignity," all while calling it "healthcare."

We are told we are a vibrant multicultural mosaic, yet we see the intentional, demographic re-engineering of our country. Our shared identity is being deliberately diluted into a bland, globalist citizenry with no common faith, no common culture, and no common cause, all to serve the interests of a political class that profits from division.

We are told our system is just, yet we see a two-tiered system of law: one for the connected elite and another for the common man. We see the original peoples of this land trapped in a cycle of dependency, their dignity traded for a government cheque in a system designed to fail them.

This is not progress. This is a managed decline into national dissolution.

### II. THE ARCHITECTS OF OUR RUIN

Who is to blame for this national suicide? Look to the Ottawa Establishment and its high priests of a secular state religion.

A political class, disconnected from the land and the people, who view this nation not as a sacred trust but as a failed project to be dismantled and rebuilt in their own image.

They are sustained by a compliant media that manufactures consent, an academic establishment that rewrites our history to be a story of shame, and a globalist ideology that despises the very idea of a sovereign, Christian nation.

They have broken the covenant with the people. They have forfeited their right to govern.

### III. THE VISION OF THE REPUBLIC

We do not come with grievances alone. We come with a plan. We have forged a new Constitution, built on the rock of immutable truths, not the shifting sands of political fashion. Our Republic will be founded on these pillars:

**A Nation of Life:** We will defend every human life, from the moment of conception to its natural end. The authority to end a life belongs to God alone.

**A Nation of Faith and Freedom:** We will be a nation that honors God in its public square, taking its moral guidance from the Holy Bible. Yet, we will fiercely protect the God-given free will of every individual to worship as their conscience dictates, or not at all.

**A Nation of Strong Families:** We will restore the sacred covenant of Marriage between one man and one woman as the bedrock of our society. We will restore parents to their rightful place as the primary educators and protectors of their own children, breaking the state's indoctrination machine.

**A Nation of Free Citizens:** We will protect the absolute right of a free and honest citizen to speak the truth without fear. We will guarantee the uninfringeable right of the people to keep and bear arms, ensuring they are the masters of the state, and not its subjects.

**A Nation of Sound Money and Honest Labour:** We will end the tyranny of deficits and debt. Our government will be constitutionally forbidden from spending more than it takes. The federal tax burden will be capped, and the currency will be sound. Your property will be yours, and the fruits of your labour will be protected.

**A Nation of True Justice:** We will end the corrupt system of political prosecution and create a judiciary appointed on merit alone. We will finally and permanently end the failed *Indian Act* and the reserve system, not with another program, but with a grand offer of freedom, capital, and private property to every Indigenous individual. We will offer dignity, not dependency.

**A Nation Governed by the People:** And to ensure these promises are never again broken, we will create a **Citizen's Oversight Tribune**â€”a fourth branch of government, selected by lottery from the people themselves, with the absolute power to investigate and hold every corner of the government accountable. The people will be the permanent, final check on all power.

### IV. THE PATH TO RESTORATION

We will not seize power in the dark. We will put this choice to the people. Our **Transitional Act** lays out a clear, orderly path.

We demand a national referendum on the new Constitution. A 60% supermajority will give us the mandate to act. A temporary council of esteemed jurists and leaders will oversee a stable, 180-day transition, culminating in the first free and fair election of the new Republic.

This is the final, peaceful path available to us.

### V. CHOOSE THIS DAY

The choice before you is clear. It is not between left and right. It is between survival and surrender.

Do you choose continued, managed decline, or do you choose rebirth? Do you choose the hollow promises of a failed system, or do you choose the hard path of liberty and responsibility?

We have built the ark. We have drafted the plans. We have chosen our standard. Now, we turn to you, the forgotten people of this great land.

**Join us. Study the Constitution. Prepare yourself.**

The time for asking is over. The time for choosing is now.

**For Faith, For Family, For Freedom!**

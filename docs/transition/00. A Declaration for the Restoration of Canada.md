# A DECLARATION FOR THE RESTORATION OF CANADA

---

### PREAMBLE

This is not a petition for redress. We are long past asking for reforms from a system that is deaf to reason and blind to its own decay. This is a declaration of intent, a final warning, and a sacred promise to our children. The nation founded by our forefathers is dying, and we will not stand idly by to watch it draw its last, managed breath. We will restore it, or we will build it anew from the ashes.

### I. THE INDICTMENT

We declare that the contract between the government and the people has been broken. The state has become an instrument of national decline, and we hold it accountable for these grave injuries:

*   **It has made us a nation of debt slaves.** A government without limit borrows against our children's future to fund its present corruption, while the dollar in your pocket is silently stolen by the slow poison of inflation.
*   **It has made us subjects, not citizens.** Our speech is policed for "wrong-think," our property is taxed into oblivion, our firearms are confiscated like those of a conquered people, and our parental authority is usurped by a state that believes it owns our children.
*   **It has cultivated a culture of death.** We extinguish the lives of the unborn in the name of convenience and euthanize the elderly in the name of "dignity," all while calling it "healthcare."
*   **It has dissolved our common identity.** We see the intentional, demographic re-engineering of our country. Our shared heritage is being deliberately diluted into a bland, globalist citizenry with no common faith, no common culture, and no common cause.
*   **It has abandoned true justice.** We see a two-tiered system of law: one for the connected elite and another for the common man. We see the original peoples of this land trapped in a cycle of dependency, their dignity traded for a government cheque in a system designed to fail them.

This is not progress. This is a managed demolition of a nation.

### II. THE ARCHITECTS OF RUIN

We declare that this national suicide is the deliberate work of a ruling class that has forfeited its right to govern. They are the Ottawa Establishment and its high priests of a secular state religion.

They are a political class, disconnected from the land and the people, who view this nation not as a sacred trust but as a failed project to be dismantled and rebuilt in their own image. They are sustained by a compliant media that manufactures consent, an academic establishment that rewrites our history to be a story of shame, and a globalist ideology that despises the very idea of a sovereign, God-honoring nation.

### III. THE VISION OF THE COVENANT

Therefore, we do not come with grievances alone. We come with a blueprint for restoration. We have forged **The Dominion Covenant**, a new constitution built upon the rock of immutable truths, not the shifting sands of political fashion.

We declare that under this Covenant:

*   **We will be a Nation of Life.** We will defend every human life, from the moment of conception to its natural end. The authority to end a life belongs to God alone.
*   **We will be a Nation of Faith and Freedom.** We will be a nation that honors God in its public square, taking its moral guidance from the Holy Bible, while fiercely protecting the God-given free will of every individual.
*   **We will be a Nation of Strong Families.** We will restore the sacred covenant of Marriage between one man and one woman as the bedrock of society. We will restore parents to their rightful place as the primary protectors of their own children, breaking the state's indoctrination machine.
*   **We will be a Nation of Free Citizens.** We will protect the absolute right to speak the truth without fear and guarantee the uninfringeable right of the people to keep and bear arms, ensuring they are the masters of the state, not its subjects.
*   **We will be a Nation of Sound Money and Honest Labour.** We will end the tyranny of deficits and debt. Our government will be constitutionally forbidden from spending more than it takes. The currency will be sound, your property will be yours, and the fruits of your labour will be protected.
*   **We will be a Nation of True Justice.** We will restore a justice system that is both swift and righteous, with a single, high standard of law for the powerful and the common man alike. Its purpose shall be clear: to protect the innocent, punish the guilty, and ensure the peace and safety of our communities. As our first demonstration of this renewed commitment, we will dismantle the ultimate symbol of unequal law—the failed *Indian Act*—and replace it not with another program, but by opening the path for every Indigenous individual to build their own future on the bedrock of freedom, capital, and private property—offering true dignity, not perpetual dependency.
*   **We will be a Nation of Governed by the People.** And to ensure these promises are never again broken, we will create a **Public Tribune**—a fourth branch of government selected by lottery from the people themselves, with the absolute power to investigate and hold every corner of the government accountable.

### IV. THE ORDERLY PATH TO RESTORATION

We will not seize power in the dark. We will put this choice to the people in a clear and orderly process, as laid out in our **Transitional Acts**.

We demand a national referendum on the new Constitution. A 60% supermajority will give a **Provisional Council** the undeniable mandate to act. This council of esteemed, non-partisan leaders will oversee a stable, 180-day transition, culminating in the first free and fair election under the new Covenant.

This is the final, peaceful path available to us.

### V. CHOOSE THIS DAY

The choice before you is clear. It is not between left and right. It is between survival and surrender.

Do you choose continued, managed decline, or do you choose rebirth? Do you choose the hollow promises of a failed system, or do you choose the hard path of liberty and responsibility?

We have built the ark. We have drafted the plans. We have chosen our standard. Now, we turn to you, the forgotten people of this great land.

**Join us. Study the Covenant. Prepare yourself.**

The time for asking is over. The time for choosing is now.

**For Faith, For Family, For Freedom!**

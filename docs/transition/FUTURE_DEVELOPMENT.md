# Future Development Plan for the Transitional Framework

---

### Preamble

The core legal scaffolding for the "Secure, Rebuild, and Repeat" model is now complete (documents `00` through `05`). The next phase of development should focus on creating the ancillary, practical "field manuals" necessary to support the people and provisional governments on the ground during a restoration.

This document serves as the official to-do list for these supporting materials.

---

### I. The "Starter Kit" for Local Restoration (`Covenant Freehold` Level)

These documents are the essential, day-one tools needed to implement the `01. The Mandate for Local Restoration`.

*   [ ] **Create `A Citizen's Guide to Forming a Covenant Freehold.md`**
    *   **Purpose:** A simple, step-by-step "how-to" guide for ordinary citizens to establish a local Restoration Council. Should include checklists, sample oaths, and a list of first-priority actions.

*   [ ] **Create `Emergency Rules of Engagement for Community Militias.md`**
    *   **Purpose:** A clear, simple code of conduct for newly formed volunteer militias to ensure they operate under the rule of law and prevent vigilantism. Must define the chain of command and the justifiable use of force.

### II. The Emergency Legal and Economic Framework

These are pre-written, temporary decrees that can be adopted instantly to prevent societal breakdown.

*   [ ] **Create `The Emergency Justice Code (Transitional).md`**
    *   **Purpose:** A brutally simple, temporary criminal code focusing only on core offenses (murder, theft, etc.) with clear, mandatory punishments to maintain order until a full court system is restored.

*   [ ] **Create `The Emergency Economic Stabilization Decree.md`**
    *   **Purpose:** A decree to prevent economic chaos. Should include measures to establish a temporary medium of exchange, prohibit price gouging, and allow for the rationing of essential goods.

### III. Procedural and Communications Guides

These documents provide the tools for governance and for spreading the restoration message.

*   [ ] **Create `Standing Orders for Provisional Assemblies.md`**
    *   **Purpose:** A simplified set of parliamentary procedures for the new Regional and Provincial assemblies to conduct business in an orderly fashion.

*   [ ] **Create a sub-folder: `The Restoration Communicator's Kit`**
    *   **Purpose:** A collection of assets to ensure a unified and professional message for the restoration movement.
    *   **Contents to include:**
        *   [ ] The `Declaration` in multiple, easily distributable formats (e.g., plain text, PDF).
        *   [ ] High-resolution digital files of the Dominion Standard flag and Coat of Arms.
        *   [ ] Template radio PSA scripts.
        *   [ ] A simple visual style guide.

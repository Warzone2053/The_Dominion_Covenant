# Memorandum on the Hermeneutics of Law: A New Covenant Theonomy

---

### PREAMBLE

This memorandum serves as the definitive hermeneutical guide to the Dominion Covenant project. Its purpose is to articulate the precise method by which the Covenant derives its legal and governing principles from the Holy Bible. The relationship between the Old and New Testaments regarding civil law is the single most complex question in Christian political theology, and any serious constitutional framework must answer it with clarity and coherence.

The Dominion Covenant charts a specific, Christ-centered path that is designed to avoid the common errors of both radical discontinuity—which discards the Old Testament's wisdom—and a flat-text literalism that ignores the profound fulfillment and re-framing brought by the New Covenant. This document explains that path.

### I. The Foundational Problem: The Two Covenants

The central question for any Christian statecraft is this: How does the New Covenant in Christ relate to the Mosaic Covenant given to the nation of Israel? The Old Testament contains a detailed civil code, given by God Himself as the perfect law for His people. The New Testament declares that believers are no longer "under the law but under grace."

Any system of Christian law must resolve this apparent tension. To fail here is to build a nation's legal and moral foundation on sand.

### II. The Rejection of Two Common Errors

The Dominion Covenant establishes its unique position by first rejecting two prevalent but flawed approaches to this problem.

**1. Error 1: The Error of Radical Discontinuity (Legal Antinomianism)**
This is the default view of much of modern Western Christianity. It holds that the Old Testament, particularly its civil and criminal laws, has been completely abrogated by Christ and thus has no binding relevance for civil government today. In this view, the state should be governed by natural law, reason, and common grace alone.

The Covenant rejects this position as a form of functional Marcionism. It ignores the unity of Scripture, the unchanging nature of God's justice, and the explicit statement of Christ that He came not to abolish the Law, but to fulfill it. To discard the Old Testament is to discard the very foundation upon which the New is built. This creates a legal and moral vacuum, which the state inevitably fills with its own autonomous, humanistic law, leading directly to the tyrannical "Genesis 3:5 Principle" where man declares himself to be god, knowing good and evil.

**2. Error 2: The Error of Flat-Text Literalism (Judaizing)**
This is the simplistic view that every statute from the Mosaic civil code should be applied literally today, without the interpretive filter of Christ's fulfillment. This approach fails to recognize the unique redemptive-historical context of ancient Israel as a typological theocracy.

The Covenant rejects this position as a failure to read the Bible Christologically. It ignores the definitive ruling of the Jerusalem Council in Acts 15, which freed Gentile believers from the burdens of the Mosaic code, and it minimizes the profound theological shifts of the New Covenant, which established a transnational Church as the people of God, distinct from any single nation-state. This error attempts to pour the new wine of the Gospel into the old wineskins of a national, typological theocracy—the very thing Christ warned against. It disrespects the finality of Christ's work and risks turning a message of grace into a program of political coercion.

### III. The Covenant's Solution: Christ as the Definitive Interpretive Key

The Dominion Covenant’s hermeneutic is therefore Christological. It affirms that the *whole* Bible is the Word of God, but it insists that the Old Testament must be read through the lens of its fulfillment in the New, as revealed definitively in the person and work of Jesus Christ.

This principle is best understood through an architectural analogy:
*   The **Old Testament** reveals the eternal **"materials science"** of God's justice. It defines the unchanging properties of right and wrong—the moral physics of God's created order.
*   The **New Testament** provides the **"master blueprint"** in Christ. It reveals the ultimate design and purpose, showing how those timeless materials are to be assembled in the current age of the Church and the nations.

This leads to a **Threefold Transmutation of the Law through Christ:**

1.  **The Moral Law is *Confirmed*.** The Ten Commandments and the moral principles they represent are rooted in God's eternal character. Christ and His apostles consistently reaffirm this law as the enduring standard of righteousness. It is this moral law that is enshrined as the unchangeable bedrock of the **Core Immutable Principles**.

2.  **The Ceremonial Law is *Fulfilled*.** Christ is the final High Priest and the ultimate sacrifice. The laws of temple, sacrifice, and priesthood are gloriously obsolete because their purpose is perfectly and eternally completed in Him.

3.  **The Civil Law is *Transmuted*.** The Mosaic civil law is neither completely abrogated nor literally re-imposed. Instead, it is **transmuted**. Its underlying principles of perfect justice—its **"general equity"**—are separated from their specific application to the unique, pre-Christian theocracy of Israel. These timeless principles are then filtered through the ethical lens of the New Covenant—mercy, humility, grace, and an awareness of human fallibility—to be wisely applied in a modern constitutional context.

The key to this transmutation is the concept of **"general equity."** This classical Reformed principle distinguishes between the *specific statute* given to ancient Israel and the *universal moral principle* that underlies it. The general equity is the timeless, trans-cultural moral logic of the law. For example, the Mosaic law commanded that a house built with a flat roof must have a parapet, or fence, to prevent people from falling off (Deuteronomy 22:8).

*   The **specific statute** (build a parapet) is culturally and architecturally bound to that time and place.
*   The **general equity** (a property owner has a positive duty to take reasonable precautions to ensure their property does not pose a direct threat to the life and limb of their neighbors and visitors) is a universal, unchanging principle of justice.

The Dominion Covenant consistently applies this method: it seeks to understand and constitutionally enshrine the *general equity* of God's law, not to slavishly copy its ancient statutory form.

### IV. Practical Application within the Dominion Covenant (Case Studies)

This hermeneutic is not merely theoretical; it is the practical engine of the Covenant's entire legal structure.

*   **Case Study 1: The Law of Punishment.**
    *   **OT Principle:** The demand for proportional justice (*lex talionis*) and the ultimate penalty for murder to purge the guilt of innocent blood from the land.
    *   **NT Transmutation:** The New Covenant's ethical filter, recognizing the fallibility of human institutions and the state's limited, servant role, transmutes this principle. The **prudential abolition of capital punishment**, as explained in the `Memorandum on the Preservation of Life`, fulfills the *principle* of justice (the permanent removal of the murderer from society via Civil Death) without the state wielding an irrevocable power it may err in using. It is an act of profound humility and reverence for life.

*   **Case Study 2: The Law of the Family.**
    *   **OT Principle:** Marriage is established at creation as a sacred covenant between one man and one woman.
    *   **NT Transmutation:** The New Covenant elevates and deepens this understanding by revealing marriage as a profound mystery that reflects the relationship between Christ and His Church (Ephesians 5). This Christological understanding becomes the guiding principle for family virtue and reciprocal duties in the **National Covenant**.

*   **Case Study 3: The Law of Charity.**
    *   **OT Principle:** The law commands care for the "widow, the orphan, and the sojourner" through provisions like gleaning laws.
    *   **NT Transmutation:** In the New Covenant, the Body of Christ—the Church and its people—becomes the primary agent of mercy and charity. This principle transmutes a state-run welfare system into the framework of **Article 8 of the Core Immutable Principles**, which empowers and protects **Private Charity** and establishes the **National Benevolence Fund** to facilitate, not replace, the charitable work of the people.

*   **Case Study 4: The Law of Due Process.**
    *   **OT Principle:** The Mosaic law established rigorous standards of evidence to protect the innocent from false accusation, chief among them the requirement of "two or three witnesses" to secure a conviction, especially in a capital case (Deuteronomy 19:15). This establishes the principle that the state's power to prosecute must be checked by a high burden of proof.
    *   **NT Transmutation:** The New Covenant affirms this high regard for truth and justice. The Dominion Covenant transmutes this principle into a modern, robust system of due process. The requirement for a **Grand Jury indictment** before a serious trial can even commence, as established in **Article 6 of the Core Immutable Principles**, is a direct application of this "multiple witness" equity. It ensures that no citizen can be subjected to the ordeal of a trial based on the accusation of a single state agent; rather, a body of the people's peers must first agree that substantial evidence exists. This protects the innocent while upholding the machinery of justice.

### V. Conclusion: A Christ-Centered Constitutionalism

The Dominion Covenant is not a "return to the Old Testament." It is a step forward under the **whole counsel of God**, as definitively and finally revealed in the person and work of Jesus Christ. It does not seek to rebuild ancient Israel, but to build a just and modern nation whose laws are in submission to Israel's God and His anointed King.

This framework is therefore not a reactionary or nostalgic project. It is the robust and deeply considered application of a **New Covenant Theonomy**—a system of government and law that is truly and fully Christ-centered.

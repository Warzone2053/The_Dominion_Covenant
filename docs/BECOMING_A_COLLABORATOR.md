# Becoming a Project Collaborator
### A Guide for Substantive Contributors to the Dominion Covenant

### PREAMBLE: AN INVITATION TO SERIOUS MINDS

The Dominion Covenant is a comprehensive thought experiment in constitutional design, undertaken with the highest degree of intellectual, philosophical, and theological rigor. Its purpose is to construct a complete, coherent, and internally consistent framework for a potential future Canada.

This is not a typical open-source project. It is a curated work with a singular, foundational vision. However, a single mind can never identify every potential loophole, every unintended consequence, or every opportunity for greater clarity and strength.

Therefore, this project welcomes and invites collaboration from serious, good-faith thinkers who wish to engage with these ideas, test the framework's integrity, and contribute to its refinement. This document outlines the philosophy, the process, and the expectations for becoming a valued collaborator.

### 1. The Guiding Philosophy of Collaboration

To maintain the project's integrity, all collaboration is governed by these core principles:

*   **Respect the Foundation:** The three central charters—the **Core Immutable Principles**, the **Constitution of Government**, and the **National Covenant**—form the unchangeable bedrock of the project. Collaboration is focused on *building upon* this foundation, not altering its core tenets. The goal is to ensure the model legislation and secondary structures are in perfect alignment with the principles, not to debate the principles themselves.

*   **Seek to Strengthen, Not Replace:** A valued collaborator does not arrive with the intent to demolish the existing structure and build their own. Rather, they act as a master craftsperson, tapping on the walls to find weaknesses, examining the joints for stress, and suggesting ways to make the entire edifice stronger and more resilient.

*   **Engage in Good Faith:** All discussion and debate must be conducted with intellectual honesty and mutual respect. The goal is a shared pursuit of a more perfect model, not to "win" an argument. Good-faith engagement means being willing to challenge ideas, but also being willing to have your own ideas challenged and refined by the logic of the framework.

*   **Quality Over Quantity:** A single, well-reasoned paragraph that identifies a genuine inconsistency and proposes a thoughtful solution is infinitely more valuable than a dozen low-effort comments.

### 2. The Ideal Collaborator Profile

We are looking for individuals who fit one or more of the following profiles:

*   **The Philosopher-King:** A deep thinker with a background in political philosophy, theology, history, or constitutional law, who can debate the first principles and their logical application.

*   **The Systems Architect:** An individual who excels at systems-level thinking. They can see how a small change in `The National Militia Act` might create a constitutional conflict with `Article IX` of the `Core Immutable Principles`.

*   **The "Red Team" Specialist:** A person who delights in finding loopholes, edge cases, and potential exploits. Their role is to stress-test the legal and procedural framework to identify how it might fail or be abused, so those weaknesses can be fortified.

*   **The Scribe:** A clear writer and thinker who can identify ambiguous language, propose more precise wording, and help ensure the entire body of work reads as if from a single, authoritative voice.

### 3. The Path to Collaboration

If the philosophy above resonates with you, here is how you can become an active contributor:

1.  **Step 1: Immerse Yourself.** The prerequisite for any meaningful contribution is a thorough understanding of the existing work. Before engaging, please read the foundational charters (`00`, `01`, `02`, `03`) and the `Defined_Terms_Concordance.md`.

2.  **Step 2: Join the Discussion.** The primary forum for collaboration is the **GitHub Discussions** tab of this repository. This is where we engage in high-level debate. Introduce yourself, engage with existing topics, or tackle one of the pinned "Hard Problems."

3.  **Step 3: Propose a Change.** We use a two-tier model for contributions:

    *   **For Minor Fixes (Typos, Formatting):** Feel free to submit a **Pull Request** directly. This is a great way to make a first contribution.
    *   **For Substantive Changes (Altering Logic or Meaning):** You **must** first open a **GitHub Issue** to propose and discuss the change. Once it is approved, you may then submit a Pull Request that implements the agreed-upon solution.

    For substantive matters, the **quality of your argument in the issue is your application.** The Pull Request is the final, practical demonstration of your ability to execute the solution.

### 4. Technical Workflow and Standards

To maintain a clean and understandable project history, all contributions must adhere to the following technical standards:

*   **Branching Strategy:** All work must be done on a separate **feature branch**. Branch names should be descriptive, using a `type/description` format (e.g., `feat/add-tribune-powers`, `fix/clarify-senate-voting`). Direct commits to the `main` branch are prohibited.

*   **Commit Message Convention:** We use the **Conventional Commits** standard. This creates a clear and machine-readable commit history. The format is `type(scope): subject`. Please review the `STYLE_GUIDE.md` for a full list of valid types and scopes.

*   **The Git Workflow:**
    1.  Ensure your local `main` branch is up-to-date.
    2.  Create a new feature branch from `main`.
    3.  Make your changes. Commit your work in small, logical chunks with clear commit messages.
    4.  Push your branch to the remote repository.
    5.  Open a **Pull Request (PR)** to merge your feature branch into `main`. Provide a clear description of the changes in the PR and link it to any relevant Issue.
    6.  After the PR is reviewed and approved, it will be merged by the project owner.

### 5. A Zero-Tolerance Policy on Disruptive Conduct

To maintain a high standard of intellectual discourse, the following behaviors are strictly prohibited and will result in an immediate and permanent ban without warning:

*   **Personal Attacks:** Attacking a person rather than their ideas.
*   **Bad-Faith Engagement:** Trolling, deliberate misrepresentation, or engaging in a manner intended to disrupt productive conversation.
*   **Incitement and Dehumanization:** Advocating violence or promoting the denial of any person's fundamental human dignity or rights.
*   **Spam and Off-Topic Promotion.**
*   **Persistent Refusal to Engage with the Project's Foundation.**

This policy exists to protect the *dignity and rights of persons*, not to shield *ideas* from rigorous and critical debate.

### 6. Contribution Policy and License Agreement

By submitting a pull request, you represent that you have the right to license your contribution, and you agree that your contribution is licensed to the Dominion Covenant project ("the Project") under the following terms:

1.  **Grant of License:** You grant to the Project and its owner a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute your contributions and such derivative works.

2.  **Cession of Rights:** You agree that your contribution becomes an integral part of the Project. You waive any right to claim ownership over the final, combined work or to demand the removal of your contribution from the Project at a later date.

In short, by contributing, you are gifting your improvements to the Project to be used without restriction, and you agree that the project owner will retain sole and exclusive copyright over the work as a whole.

---

### 7. Project Governance and Recognition

*   **Governance Model:** This project is managed under a **"Benevolent Dictator for Life" (BDFL)** model. While open discussion is highly encouraged, the final decision on what is merged rests with the original author to ensure a cohesive and philosophically consistent final work.

*   **Recognition of Contributions:** All individuals who make a substantive contribution will be formally and publicly credited in the dedicated `ACKNOWLEDGMENTS.md` file.

If this structured, rigorous, and respectful approach to collaboration appeals to you, then your voice and intellect are welcome. We look forward to engaging with you in the shared task of refining this blueprint for a just and ordered liberty.

# Memorandum on the Doctrine of the Sword and the Office of the Citizen-Soldier

---

### PREAMBLE

The single most radical departure the Dominion Covenant makes from the structure of modern Western states is its absolute prohibition of a professional standing army and its complete reliance on a system of well-regulated provincial militias. This memorandum is intended to make the reasoning for this foundational choice unequivocally clear.

The militia system is not a policy preference, a historical reenactment, or a cost-saving measure. It is a **constitutional necessity**. It is the carefully engineered answer to the most fundamental question of political philosophy: *Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?*—Who guards the guardians?

This document outlines the philosophy that underpins the militia's structure, demonstrating why it is the sole military model capable of defending the nation from foreign threats while simultaneously serving as the ultimate, non-negotiable guarantor of domestic liberty.

### I. The Foundational Problem: The Inherent Danger of a Professional Standing Army

The Dominion Covenant is built upon a sober and skeptical view of concentrated power. It recognizes that the single greatest potential threat to the long-term survival of a free republic is not a foreign army, but its own.

A professional standing army, by its very nature, becomes a tool of the executive branch of government. It is a powerful, centralized, and hierarchical institution whose members are, by necessity, trained to obey a chain of command. Over time, it develops a culture distinct from the general populace, becoming a class apart. History is an unsparing and repetitive teacher on this point: a standing army is a loaded gun placed permanently in the hands of the state. In the hands of a virtuous leader, it is a shield; in the hands of a tyrant, it is the instrument of the people's subjugation.

A system of government that hopes to last for centuries cannot be based on the hope of perpetual virtuous leadership. It must be architected to withstand the inevitable rise of ambitious and corrupt leaders. Therefore, the Covenant's first principle of national defense is to **disarm the central state** of this dangerous tool and place the power of the sword irrevocably into the hands of the people themselves.

### II. The Biblical Precedent: The King's Army vs. The People's Levy

The Covenant's reliance on a citizen militia is not a modern invention but a deliberate return to the military and political model prescribed and practiced in the Holy Bible. The Scriptures consistently present two opposing models of military power: the centralized army of a king, and the decentralized defensive levy of the people.

The King's Army is consistently portrayed as a tool of state ambition and a threat to liberty. When the people of Israel demanded a king to be like other nations, the prophet Samuel issued a divine warning that the first and primary instrument of their oppression would be a standing army. A king, he said, **"will take your sons and appoint them for his own chariots... He will take the best of your fields... and you yourselves will be his servants"** (1 Samuel 8:11-17). This model serves the ruler.

The People's Levy, by contrast, is the biblical ideal for a free people. The armies that defended Israel under judges like Gideon were not professional forces; they were a temporary muster of the tribes, where free men left their farms and trades to defend the nation and then returned to their homes. This model is perfectly embodied in the **Nehemiah Principle**, where those rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem did so with a tool in one hand and a weapon in the other (Nehemiah 4:17). This establishes the foundational biblical ideal: the productive citizen is the vigilant defender. The duty to build and the duty to defend are one and the same office.

The militia system of the Dominion Covenant is the direct application of this biblical principle. It rejects the model of the King's Army and constitutionally enshrines the model of the People's Levy, ensuring the state remains a servant, not a master with a standing force at its command.

### III. The Architectural Solution: A Constitutionally Decentralized Force

The `National Militia Act` is the blueprint for a military force that is both effective against foreign enemies and incapable of being used for domestic tyranny. It achieves this through a multi-layered, decentralized design.

1.  **Decentralization as a Bulwark Against Coups:** The core of the nation's military power resides in the **Regulated Militias of the Provinces**. There is no single national army. A standing army represents a single point of failure; by seizing control of its command structure, a tyrant can seize control of the nation. Under the Covenant, a would-be dictator would face the mathematically improbable task of co-opting ten separate Adjutants General, in ten different provinces, each confirmed by their own legislature, to turn on their own people. The decentralized structure is a constitutional firewall against a centralized coup.

2.  **Universal Service to Prevent a "Warrior Caste":** The militia is founded on the principle of **universal service**. It is not a volunteer force of specialists; it is a citizen force. This ensures the army *is* the people. When the banker, the farmer, the software developer, and the mechanic are the army, the army's values are inseparable from the people's values. An order to suppress their own families, neighbors, and communities would be a psychological and moral impossibility.

3.  **A Defensive Posture to Prevent Foreign Adventurism:** A professional army is a tool that tempts its owners to find uses for it. It enables and encourages governments to engage in wars of choice and foreign interventions that do not serve the direct, existential interests of the nation. A citizen militia is inherently defensive. The people who must pay the price in blood are the same people who authorize the conflict. This structure naturally reinforces the non-interventionist foreign policy of the Covenant, reserving the profound act of war for the sole purpose of defending the homeland.

4.  **A Dual-Component Structure for Readiness and Resilience:** The Covenant solves the classic dilemma of a citizen army—how to maintain a high state of readiness—through its hybrid structure.
    *   The **Ready Reaction Units (RRUs)** are the professional, full-time "tip of the spear." They provide the nation with a high-readiness force and a professional training cadre.
    *   The **Militia Reserve** is the "shaft of the spear," providing the deep, popular resilience and mass mobilization capability required for a major defensive war.
    This model provides the benefits of a professional force without creating the danger of a large, standing army.

### IV. The Final Guarantee: The Interoperability Mandate

The final and most absolute check on state power is established in **Article 9 of the Core Immutable Principles** and executed by the `National Militia Act`. The state is constitutionally forbidden from adopting any standard-issue personal arm for the Regulated Militias unless that arm, or its functional equivalent, is available for lawful acquisition by the general citizenry.

The purpose of this clause is not hunting or sport. Its purpose is to **prevent the state from ever achieving a fatal asymmetry of force over the people it governs.** It ensures that the citizen and the citizen-soldier are one and the same. It makes the people a credible and permanent check on the power of the state, guaranteeing that the government must always govern by consent, not by coercion. It is the final, non-negotiable line of defense for all other rights enumerated in the Constitution.

### V. On Order, Discipline, and the Rejection of Anarchy

It is crucial to distinguish the Covenant's model from a disorganized, anarchic mob. The force established herein is not an "unregulated" militia; it is a **Regulated Militia**. It is a disciplined body, subject to the highest law of the land.

*   It is governed by a single, national **Uniform Code of Military Justice**.
*   Its professional training standards are set by the **Federal Command for Materiel and Doctrine**.
*   Its officer corps is educated at the **National Defense Academies**.
*   Its professional core—the **Ready Reaction Units**—ensures a permanent cadre of disciplined, high-readiness soldiers.

This is a system of ordered liberty, not a license for chaos. It places the ultimate power of the sword in the hands of the people, but it does so within a framework of rigorous law, training, and discipline, ensuring the militia is a guardian of the peace, not a threat to it.

### VI. Conclusion: The Militia as the Embodiment of Sovereignty and Virtue

The National Militia system is far more than a military organization. It is the physical manifestation of the Dominion Covenant's entire philosophy. It is the constitutional immune system designed to protect the body politic from both external threats and the internal disease of tyranny.

It is founded on the core belief that rights are inseparable from duties, but it goes further. It asserts that the **Office of the Citizen-Soldier** is a high moral calling, demanding the very virtues articulated in the **National Covenant**. The ideal defender is not a mere conscript, but a citizen who embodies **Personal Responsibility**, **Diligence**, and **Temperance**. Their service is the ultimate expression of **Patriotism and Service**, a duty performed not for a wage, but for the love of one's neighbor, family, and homeland.

The militia, therefore, ensures that the ultimate earthly sovereignty of the nation resides not in its government, its courts, or a professional military, but in the people themselves—armed, organized, disciplined, and **virtuous**. It ensures the government remains the servant of a free and sovereign people, and not their master.

# Memorandum on the Foundation of Law and Liberty: A Defense of the Covenanted State

---

### PREAMBLE

This memorandum addresses the most fundamental choice any nation must make: the choice of its ultimate authority. It is a defense of the Dominion Covenant's foundational premise—that a just, free, and enduring nation must be built upon the rock of Divine Law, not the shifting sands of human reason or popular will.

This is not an argument for theocracy, which is the rule by a priestly class. It is an argument for **theonomy**, which is the rule of God's Law itself, to which all citizens and all branches of government, including any church, are equally subject. This document will deconstruct the claims of the modern secular state and make the case that a Covenanted State, founded in submission to the God of the Holy Bible, is the only viable path to a just and lasting liberty.

### I. The Inescapable Question: What is the Source of Law?

Every legal system has a "god." Every state has an ultimate, final, non-negotiable source of authority from which all laws derive their legitimacy and to which there is no higher appeal. This ultimate authority functions as the god of that system. The question for any nation is not *whether* it will have a god, but *which* god it will choose.

This source of law is the point of sovereignty. Whatever it declares to be right is right; whatever it declares to be wrong is wrong. It is the final arbiter of reality for that society.

### II. The Secular State and Its "God": The Genesis 3:5 Principle

The modern secular state claims to be neutral, rational, and without a god. It claims its authority derives from "The People," "Reason," or "Human Rights." This is a profound deception. In theological reality, the secular state is founded upon the very first principle of rebellion articulated by the Serpent in the Garden of Eden:

> **"...you will be like God, knowing good and evil." (Genesis 3:5)**

This is the **Genesis 3:5 Principle**. It is the belief that Man can be the autonomous, sovereign source of his own reality, his own morality, and his own law. This principle is the true god of the secular state.

Secularism, therefore, is not an absence of faith; it is a competing religion. It is the established state religion of Secular Humanism, with Man as its deity. Its church is the state itself, and its dogmas—human autonomy, self-realization, and the denial of any transcendent authority—are enforced with the full power of the law, tolerating no heresy that challenges its core creed of human sovereignty.

### III. The Fruits of the Genesis 3:5 Principle: A Diagnosis of Decay

A legal and political system founded on the lie of human autonomy will inevitably bear corrupt fruit. When Man is his own god, the predictable results are:

*   **Moral Relativism:** With no transcendent, objective standard of right and wrong, law ceases to be about justice and becomes a mere expression of raw power. What is "right" is simply what the majority, the courts, or the administrative state declares it to be at any given moment.
*   **The Erosion of Rights:** If rights are granted by the state or by popular consensus, they are not rights at all; they are temporary privileges. They can be redefined, reinterpreted, or revoked entirely by the same human authority that created them.
*   **Unlimited Government:** If Man is the ultimate authority, then the state that claims to represent Man can claim unlimited power. There is nothing above the state to say "no." It becomes a new Leviathan, accountable to nothing but its own will, free to redefine life, marriage, family, and freedom itself.
*   **Societal Dissolution:** The loss of a shared, transcendent purpose leads directly to the decay of the family, the community, and national identity. When each individual is their own lawgiver, bound by nothing but their own will, the social fabric unravels into a war of all against all.

### IV. The Covenanted State: The Rejection of the Lie

The Dominion Covenant is the explicit, deliberate, and total rejection of the Genesis 3:5 Principle. Its foundational premise is **submission**, not autonomy. It asserts that law is not invented by Man, but is *discovered* from the divine revelation of the one, true, sovereign God.

The benefits of this foundation are absolute and provide the only stable ground for a free society:

*   **Permanence:** The moral law of God is unchanging. It provides a permanent, stable foundation for society that does not shift with public opinion or judicial fashion.
*   **Endowed Rights:** Rights are not state grants but divine endowments. Because they come from God, they are inviolable, and the state's only legitimate role is to protect them.
*   **Limited Government:** This is the most critical benefit. **Because God is sovereign, the state is not.** Divine Law is the only logically coherent and absolute check on the power of the state. It places the government itself *under* the law, creating a permanent barrier against tyranny.
*   **A Basis for True Virtue:** It provides a real, objective standard for the "good" that the *National Covenant* calls the people to pursue, grounding public life in transcendent truth rather than subjective preference.

### V. Conclusion: A Choice Between Two Faiths

The choice before any nation is not between a religious government and a "neutral" one. That is a false choice. The choice is between two faiths, two religions, and two gods.

It is a choice between a faith in the shifting, fallible, and ultimately self-destructive will of Man, a system founded on the Serpent's original lie.

Or it is a choice for a faith in the unchanging, just, and life-giving Word of God, a system founded in humble submission to the ultimate reality of His sovereign authority.

The Dominion Covenant is the sober, deliberate, and unapologetic choice for the latter, presented as the only viable path to a just, prosperous, and enduring liberty.

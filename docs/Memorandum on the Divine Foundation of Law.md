# Memorandum on the Foundation of Law and Liberty: A Defense of the Covenanted State

---

### PREAMBLE

This memorandum addresses the most fundamental choice any nation must make: the choice of its ultimate authority. It is a defense of the Dominion Covenant's foundational premise—that a just, free, and enduring nation must be built upon the rock of Divine Law, not the shifting sands of human reason or popular will.

This is not an argument for theocracy, which is the rule by a priestly class. It is an argument for **theonomy**, which is the rule of God's Law itself, to which all citizens and all branches of government, including any church, are equally subject. This document will deconstruct the claims of the modern secular state and make the case that a Covenanted State, founded in submission to the God of the Holy Bible, is the only viable path to a just and lasting liberty.

### I. The Inescapable Question: What is the Source of Law?

Every legal system has a "god." Every state has an ultimate, final, non-negotiable source of authority from which all laws derive their legitimacy and to which there is no higher appeal. This ultimate authority functions as the god of that system. The question for any nation is not *whether* it will have a god, but *which* god it will choose.

This source of law is the point of sovereignty. Whatever it declares to be right is right; whatever it declares to be wrong is wrong. It is the final arbiter of reality for that society.

### II. The Secular State and Its "God": The Genesis 3:5 Principle

The modern secular state claims to be neutral, rational, and without a god. It claims its authority derives from "The People," "Reason," or "Human Rights." This is a profound deception. In theological reality, the secular state is founded upon the very first principle of rebellion articulated by the Serpent in the Garden of Eden:

> **"...you will be like God, knowing good and evil." (Genesis 3:5)**

This is the **Genesis 3:5 Principle**. It is the belief that Man can be the autonomous, sovereign source of his own reality, his own morality, and his own law. This principle is the true god of the secular state.

Secularism, therefore, is not an absence of faith; it is a competing religion. It is the established state religion of Secular Humanism, with Man as its deity. Like any religion, it has its own non-provable dogmas (e.g., the autonomy of human reason), its own moral imperatives (e.g., self-actualization), and its own eschatology (e.g., faith in human-led progress). Its church is the state itself, and its doctrines are enforced with the full power of the law, tolerating no heresy that challenges its core creed of human sovereignty.

### III. The Fruits of the Genesis 3:5 Principle: A Diagnosis of Decay

A legal and political system founded on the lie of human autonomy will inevitably bear corrupt fruit. When Man is his own god, the predictable results are:

*   **Moral Relativism:** With no transcendent, objective standard of right and wrong, law ceases to be about justice and becomes a mere expression of raw power. What is "right" is simply what the majority, the courts, or the administrative state declares it to be at any given moment.
*   **The Erosion of Rights:** If rights are granted by the state or by popular consensus, they are not rights at all; they are temporary privileges. They can be redefined, reinterpreted, or revoked entirely by the same human authority that created them.
*   **Unlimited Government:** If Man is the ultimate authority, then the state that claims to represent Man can claim unlimited power. There is nothing above the state to say "no." It becomes a new Leviathan, accountable to nothing but its own will, free to redefine life, marriage, family, and freedom itself.
*   **Societal Dissolution:** The loss of a shared, transcendent purpose leads directly to the decay of the family, the community, and national identity. When each individual is their own lawgiver, bound by nothing but their own will, the social fabric unravels into a war of all against all.

### IV. The Covenanted State: The Mandate of the *Diakonos*

The Dominion Covenant is the explicit, deliberate, and total rejection of the Genesis 3:5 Principle. Its foundational premise is **submission**, not autonomy. It asserts that law is not invented by Man, but is *discovered* from the divine revelation of the one, true, sovereign God.

This submission is not merely a restriction; it is a positive mandate. The Holy Bible, in Romans 13, defines the very nature and purpose of civil government. It establishes a two-sided covenant: the citizen is to be subject to the ruler, but the ruler is explicitly defined as **"God's servant" (*diakonos*)**. The ruler is God's minister, an "avenger who carries out God's wrath on the wrongdoer."

Therefore, the Covenanted State understands that its authority is **delegated, not inherent**. Its sole legitimate purpose is to fulfill its divine commission: to punish evil and to commend the good. It does not exist to redefine reality, create new moralities, or save humanity. It exists to bear the sword as an instrument of justice in the temporal realm, creating a space of order and peace where families, churches, and individuals can flourish.

### V. The Fruits of Submission: Liberty, Dignity, and Prosperity

The choice of a divine foundation is not merely a theological abstraction; it is the most practical decision a nation can make, for the foundation determines the fruit. A state built on the lie of human autonomy inevitably produces tyranny and decay. A state that submits to God's authority creates the necessary conditions for true liberty, dignity, and prosperity to flourish.

*   **It Secures Justice and Stability:** Because God's moral law is objective and unchanging, a Covenanted State provides a stable and predictable rule of law. Justice is not subject to the whims of a ruler, a court, or a mob. This is the bedrock of a secure and ordered society.

*   **It Protects Human Dignity:** The principle of *Imago Dei*—that all persons are created in the image of God—is the only logically coherent foundation for universal human rights. In a Covenanted State, the life and dignity of every person, from the pre-born child to the elderly, are protected not because the state grants them value, but because their value is endowed by their Creator.

*   **It Cultivates True Prosperity:** Divine Law sanctifies the right to property (as stewardship), commands honest weights and measures, and demands personal responsibility. This framework is uniquely suited to fostering a high-trust society where enterprise can thrive, and the fruits of honest labor are secure.

History bears witness to this truth. The freest, most prosperous, and most charitable nations—those where women are most protected and minorities most secure—are without exception the nations that were formed and most deeply influenced by the Protestant Reformation's application of biblical principles to public life. To deny this heritage is not humility; it is a foolish and ungrateful denial of the very source of our blessings.

### VI. The Benefits of the Divine Foundation

The benefits of this foundation are absolute and provide the only stable ground for a free society:

*   **Permanence:** The moral law of God is unchanging. It provides a permanent, stable foundation for society that does not shift with public opinion or judicial fashion.

*   **Endowed Rights:** Rights are not state grants but divine endowments. Because they come from God, they are inviolable, and the state's only legitimate role is to protect them.

*   **Limited Government:** This is the most critical benefit. **Because God is sovereign, the state is not.** Divine Law is the only logically coherent and absolute check on the power of the state. It places the government itself *under* the law, creating a permanent barrier against tyranny.

*   **A Basis for True Virtue:** It provides a real, objective standard for the "good" that the *National Covenant* calls the people to pursue, grounding public life in transcendent truth rather than subjective preference.

*   **Jurisdictional Integrity:** The Covenanted State recognizes the principle of **Sphere Sovereignty**. God has ordained three distinct jurisdictions: the Family (which wields the rod), the Church (which wields the keys), and the State (which wields the sword). A Covenanted State is therefore constitutionally prohibited from usurping the authority of the parent in the home or the pastor in the church. Furthermore, the distinction between these spheres defines the nature of their interaction. The Church, as the repository of divine revelation, has a prophetic duty to teach the State its obligations under God's law. It is to inform the conscience of the magistrate. However, the Church wields no sword, no constitutional authority to command, and no power of legal coercion. Its influence is purely moral and spiritual. The State, in turn, is bound by the law of God but does not take its marching orders from any ecclesiastical body. This separation of instruments—but unity of purpose under God—is the engine of a just society and the ultimate safeguard against both state tyranny and theocratic overreach.

### A Note on Terminology: The Rejection of Rhetorical Cages

The opponents of a God-honoring public square, having no coherent argument against the principles of Divine Law, resort to slander. They seek to silence debate by employing intellectually vacuous and historically ignorant labels, chief among them "Christian Nationalism."

This term, as used by its proponents, is not a meaningful descriptor but a rhetorical cage, a neo-Marxist tool designed to shame, silence, and marginalize any Christian who dares to believe that all of Christ's Word applies to all of life. It is a cynical inversion of reality, deployed by the very secularists who happily use Scripture when it serves their political ends and who have created a far more invasive state religion of their own.

The Dominion Covenant is not "nationalist" in the secular, ethnic, or chauvinistic sense. It is a framework for a **Covenanted People**. Its allegiance is not to blood or soil, but to the God who is King over all nations. We therefore reject these slanderous labels and insist on debating the substance of the ideas themselves.

### VII. Conclusion: A Choice Between Two Faiths

The choice before any nation is not between a religious government and a "neutral" one. That is a false choice. The choice is between two faiths, two religions, and two gods.

It is a choice between a faith in the shifting, fallible, and ultimately self-destructive will of Man, a system founded on the Serpent's original lie.

Or it is a choice for a faith in the unchanging, just, and life-giving Word of God, a system founded in humble submission to the ultimate reality of His sovereign authority.

The modern secular state, in its hypocrisy, has inverted the divine order. It increasingly seeks to legislate matters of the heart through hate crime laws and social engineering, while simultaneously abandoning its primary duty to punish objective evil. It has dropped the sword to pick up the keys, and in doing so, has proven itself a poor magistrate and a false church.

The Dominion Covenant is the sober, deliberate, and unapologetic choice for the latter, presented as the only viable path to a just, prosperous, and enduring liberty.

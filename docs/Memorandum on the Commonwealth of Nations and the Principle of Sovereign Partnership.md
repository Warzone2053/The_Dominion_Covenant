# Memorandum on the Commonwealth of Nations and the Principle of Sovereign Partnership

---

### PREAMBLE

The question of Canada’s relationship with the Commonwealth of Nations is a matter of deep historical and cultural significance. The Dominion Covenant, as a foundational "Year Zero" charter, must address this question not on the basis of sentiment, but on the basis of immutable principle. This memorandum clarifies the position of the Dominion of Canada under the Covenant: it is a position that rejects both subordinate membership in the old Commonwealth and a complete, isolating separation from our closest kin. Instead, it charts a third path: the creation of a new and more powerful partnership of sovereign equals.

### I. The Constitutional Barriers to Membership in the Modern Commonwealth

Under the **Dominion Covenant**, membership in the current Commonwealth of Nations is a constitutional impossibility. The structure and ideology of the modern Commonwealth are in direct and irreconcilable conflict with the foundational principles of the nation.

**1. The Conflict with Absolute National Sovereignty:**
*   **Article 12 of the Core Immutable Principles** is unequivocal: "The ultimate authority for all governance resides exclusively with the people of Canada through this Charter." The modern Commonwealth requires member states to recognize the British Monarch as the "Head of the Commonwealth." This establishes a foreign figurehead at the apex of the association, creating an external point of symbolic authority that violates the principle of absolute, undivided national sovereignty.

**2. The Power of Symbols and Ultimate Allegiance:**
*   In a nation founded by Covenant, symbols are not trivial decorations; they are declarations of ultimate allegiance. The Governor General is the living symbol of the nation's sovereignty under God. To acknowledge a second, external, and hereditary symbol as "Head" of our primary international association is to create a fatal ambiguity in our national identity. It unconstitutionally divides our symbolic allegiance and diminishes the office of our own Head of State.

**3. The Conflict with Theonomic Sovereignty:**
*   **Article 2 of the Core Immutable Principles** establishes that the nation's sovereignty is derived directly from God, as revealed in the Holy Bible. The modern Commonwealth, while having historical roots in a Christian monarchy, is today a secular body whose legitimacy rests on a charter of shared political values derived from contemporary international consensus. The conflict is therefore not merely "Christian vs. Secular," but between a nation covenanted under God's direct authority versus an association that recognizes a hereditary monarch and a subsequent secular, humanistic charter.

**4. The Conflict of Guiding Ideologies:**
*   The moral soul of the Dominion is the **National Covenant**, which articulates specific, binding virtues. The guiding document of the modern Commonwealth is its Charter, which promotes values defined by modern, transnational progressivism. On foundational issues such as the nature of family, marriage, and justice as defined in **Article 3 of the Core Immutable Principles**, these two worldviews are in direct opposition. Membership would place the Dominion in a state of perpetual ideological conflict with the stated aims of the organization.

### II. The Strategic Imperative for Sovereign Partnership

To reject membership in the modern Commonwealth is not to reject our history or our allies. A complete separation from our kin—the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and others—would be an act of profound strategic folly.

Our nation shares with these nations a priceless heritage that is the very bedrock of our liberty and order: the English language, the tradition of Common Law, and the model of Parliamentary government. To discard these bonds would be to sever a tree from its roots. This heritage is not a liability to be amended, but a strategic asset to be fortified.

### III. The Third Path: Forging a New Sovereign Compact

The Dominion Covenant therefore chooses a path of maturation, not amputation. It moves beyond the anachronistic, imperial-rooted structure of the old Commonwealth to propose a new, more powerful form of association: a treaty-based alliance of core Westminster nations, herein referred to as **The Sovereign Compact**.

This would not be an organization we *join*, but a partnership we *create*. Its purpose is to form a distinct civilizational bloc, capable of defending its shared values and interests in a world of rising autocratic powers and decaying international institutions.

The principles of this new compact would be:

| Feature | The Old Commonwealth | **The New Sovereign Compact** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Foundation** | A diverse, multicultural association of 56 nations. | A core alliance founded on shared metaphysical and cultural roots. |
| **Headship** | A foreign, symbolic Head of the Commonwealth. | A council of equal partners with **no symbolic head**. |
| **Governing Ideology**| The modern, secular Commonwealth Charter. | A treaty based on heritage, realism, and strategic necessity. |
| **Core Purpose** | Diplomatic consensus-building and development aid. | **Mutual Defense, Free Trade, and Free Movement of Peoples.** |
| **Sovereignty** | Implied subordination to a collective charter. | Explicit affirmation of the absolute sovereignty of each signatory. |

By leading the creation of such a compact, the Dominion would not be abandoning its family. It would be calling its family to a higher and stronger form of union—one based on the strength of sovereign equals, not the memory of a departed empire. This new partnership would honor our shared past by forging it into a shield for our future, fully in keeping with the principles of the **Dominion Covenant**.

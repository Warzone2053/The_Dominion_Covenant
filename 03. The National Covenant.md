# The National Covenant of Canada

---

### PREAMBLE
This National Covenant complements the Core Immutable Principles and the Constitution of Government. **Acknowledging God as the ultimate source of all moral law as affirmed in the Core Immutable Principles,** this Covenant is established to articulate a vision of a virtuous life and a just society. It is a declaration of the enduring virtues and societal aspirations that shall guide the character of the nation and its people.

Its principles are not intended to create criminal offenses or civil liabilities for which a citizen may be punished by the state. Instead, they shall serve as a mandatory guide for the Legislature in the framing of laws, for the Judiciary in their interpretation, and for the People in the conduct of their public and private lives. They are the solemn bond that unites the nation in a common moral purpose.

### ARTICLE I: THE VIRTUE OF THE INDIVIDUAL

1.  **Honesty and Integrity:** A citizen's word is their bond. Truthfulness in speech, honesty in dealings, and integrity in character are the foundations of trust upon which a free and prosperous society is built.

2.  **Diligence and Labor:** Honest labor is a dignified and essential aspect of human life. Every citizen is encouraged to apply themselves with diligence to their chosen vocation, to provide for themselves and their household, and to contribute to the well-being of the nation through their work.

3.  **Personal Responsibility:** Every citizen is called to a life of self-reliance, to be accountable for their actions, and to bear the consequences of their choices with fortitude.

4.  **Temperance and Self-Control:** The virtuous citizen strives to govern their passions, appetites, and ambitions, seeking moderation and discipline in all things.

### ARTICLE II: THE SANCTITY OF THE FAMILY

1.  **Chastity and Fidelity:** The covenant of Marriage between a man and a woman is the sacred and proper sanctuary for physical union. The nation holds as a high ideal the virtue of chastity before Marriage and of absolute fidelity within it, recognizing these as pillars of stable families and the secure upbringing of children.

2.  **Honor and Respect:** The family is an institution of reciprocal duties. Parents have a solemn obligation to raise their children with love, discipline, and moral instruction. Children, in turn, have a duty to honor their father and mother, and to ensure they are cared for in their old age.

### ARTICLE III: THE CHARACTER OF THE COMMUNITY

1.  **Charity and Hospitality:** Citizens are encouraged to show active compassion and charity to the poor, the widow, the orphan, and the stranger. A spirit of generosity and hospitality toward one's neighbor is the hallmark of a good and decent community.

2.  **Good Stewardship:** The right to property is a call to stewardship. All citizens and communities are encouraged to use the nation's lands and resources wisely, to avoid waste, and to preserve the beauty and fruitfulness of creation for future generations.

3.  **Civility and Neighborliness:** In public discourse and private interaction, citizens are called to treat one another with respect, even in disagreement. A healthy community is one where neighbors are quick to help and slow to anger.

### ARTICLE IV: THE DUTY OF THE CITIZEN

1.  **Patriotism and Service:** A citizen ought to cultivate a spirit of patriotism, which is a noble love for one's country, its people, and its principles. Where required, a citizen has a duty to aid in the defense of the nation and its liberties.

2.  **Respect for Just Law:** A virtuous citizen respects and upholds the rule of law, recognizing that it is a necessary shield for the liberty and safety of all.

3.  **Informed Participation:** In a self-governing nation, every citizen has a duty to be informed on matters of public importance, to participate thoughtfully in civic life, and to ensure that the government remains accountable to the people.

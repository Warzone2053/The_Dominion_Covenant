PROPOSED AMENDMENT FOR FUTURE CONSIDERATION
Re: Capital Punishment Exception
---

AUTHOR'S NOTE:
This proposed amendment represents a fundamental shift in the Covenant's philosophy regarding capital punishment. The decision to move from a principle of "absolute humility before irrevocable error" to a framework that permits a state-sanctioned execution, even under the strictest of standards, is a matter of profound gravity.

This text is preserved here for review, but its implementation requires deep and sober deliberation and prayer before it should ever be formally adopted into the Core Immutable Principles.

The following text is the proposed amendment for the file:
`01. THE CORE IMMUTABLE PRINCIPLES OF THE CONSTITUTION OF CANADA.md`

It would replace the current text of Article 1, Section 6. The purpose of this amendment is to introduce a narrow, biblically and forensically sound exception to the general abolition of capital punishment, to be applied only in cases of a Sovereign Offense that is proven by a "Standard of Irrefutable Guilt."

### ARTICLE 1: THE SANCTITY OF LIFE

...

6.  The authority to end a life belongs to God alone. Therefore, capital punishment is irrevocably abolished as the general standard of justice in the nation, **subject to the sole and extraordinary exception provided herein for the crime of a Sovereign Offense.** This prohibition does not extend to the necessary use of lethal force in the immediate defense of human life...

    **(a) The Capital Sentence for Irrefutably Proven Sovereign Offenses.** Notwithstanding the foregoing, a sentence of death shall be mandatory upon any person convicted of a **Sovereign Offense** if, and only if, the state proves the person's guilt by meeting the **"Standard of Irrefutable Guilt."**

    (b) **The Standard of Irrefutable Guilt.** This standard is met only when the trial jury finds that the evidence presented meets the requirements of the **Biblical Witness Pillar** and is substantially and directly corroborated by clear and convincing evidence from at least **one** of the **Corroborating Evidentiary Pillars**.

        **(i) The Biblical Witness Pillar (Mandatory):** The direct and substantially corroborating testimony of **no fewer than three credible eyewitnesses** to the physical act (*actus reus*) of the crime. For the purposes of this section, an "eyewitness" is a person who personally saw the commission of the act, and a "credible" witness is one who is not a co-conspirator or accessory to the offense.

        **(ii) The Corroborating Physical Evidence Pillar:** Irrefutable forensic or physical evidence that directly and conclusively links the accused to the commission of the act. This includes, but is not limited to, DNA evidence from the accused found on the victim or murder weapon, or a perfect fingerprint match of the accused on the murder weapon.

        **(iii) The Corroborating Recorded Evidence Pillar:** A high-fidelity and unambiguous audio or video recording of the accused committing the physical act of the crime, the authenticity of which is not in credible dispute.

    (c) **The Role of a Confession.** A formal, recorded confession, made in the presence of legal counsel after the right to silence has been waived, may serve as powerful supporting evidence. However, a confession, on its own, **shall not** be sufficient to meet the requirement for a Corroborating Evidentiary Pillar.

    (d) **The Jury's Final Determination.** The trial jury, after having returned a unanimous verdict of guilty for a Sovereign Offense, must then, in a separate and distinct deliberation, unanimously affirm that the Standard of Irrefutable Guilt has been met beyond any reasonable doubt.

    (e) **Final Sentence.** If this exceptional standard is met, the sentence of death shall be imposed. In all other convictions for a Sovereign Offense, and for all other crimes, the sentence shall be **Civil Death** or a lesser penalty as prescribed by law.
